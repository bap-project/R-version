{"content":{"0":"Artificial\u00a0intelligence was mentioned in this year's Government Work Report for the first time, which has drawn wide public attention.\u00a0\nThe report regards artificial intelligence as one of the most significant emerging industries, whose technological research and transformation will be accelerated.\nArtificial\u00a0intelligence is a branch of computer science that includes the theory, method, technology and application of simulating, extending and expanding human intelligence. Artificial\u00a0intelligence research includes intelligent robots, language recognition, image identification and natural language processing, among other things.\nIn July 2015, artificial intelligence was mentioned in the guidance issued by the State Council, China's Cabinet, to promote the government's Internet Plus plan, and artificial intelligence was included in the country's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) released in March 2016. It shows that artificial intelligence has become a significant strategic deployment in the next stage, and the industry will grow rapidly in the future.\nAt a news conference on March 11, Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang said that China had made new progress in creating artificial intelligence since last year, and a series of significant artificial intelligence projects are being conducted.\nAccording to Wan, experts, enterprises and entrepreneurs are jointly working on accelerating the development of artificial\u00a0intelligence.\n","1":"Artificial\u00a0intelligence is on the verge of becoming a 'bubble' in China as a large influx of money and talent heat the market, analysts and experts warn.\n\n\"For the job market in China's artificial intelligence sector, I see a bubble already exists now. Some practitioners in the industry are paid salaries that are unfairly high,\" said Wang Xiaochuan, chief executive officer of Chinese internet company Sogou.\u00a0\n\n\"Investors expect too high a return on their investments, and the valuations of China's artificial intelligence firms are much more expensive than those in the US.\"\n\nIn terms of investment in artificial intelligence firms, China was in second place in 2016 with US$2.6 billion, followed by the UK on US$800 million, according to data from Chinese think tank WuZhen Institute. The US topped the list with US$17.9 billion.\n\n\"The amount being invested in artificial intelligence in Asia is growing by the day,\" said KPMG partner Egidio Zarrella. \"This year will be the one that investors will look at artificial intelligence and say, 'if you're not investing in it, you're missing the boat'.\"\nInvestors expect too high a return on their investments, and the valuations of China's AI enterprises are much more expensive than those in the USWang Xiaochuan, Sogou\nThe vast amounts of capital and talent flooding into artificial intelligence industries in China is not without good reason. Artificial\u00a0intelligence is poised to transform almost every aspect of people's lives, even though it is currently somewhat limited in scope, generally working on repetitive tasks based on big data and complex calculation.\n\n\"From an economic standpoint, I believe artificial intelligence will replace human beings, including managerial and technical jobs, as well as manual labour jobs. It is almost unavoidable,\" said Ben Goertzel, chief scientist at Hanson Robotics, a company that claims it is developing the worlds' most human-like robots.\n\nSogou's Wang echoed this view, saying that artificial intelligence has numerous roles to play in business.\n\n\"For example, it is bound to help with medical breakthroughs,\" he said.\n\n\"Education will also be one of the major potential beneficiaries, which could observe learning habits and provide smart advice,\" said Zhang Shoucheng, a physics professor at Stanford University.\nI believe AI will replace human beings, including managerial and technical jobs, as well as manual labour jobs. It is almost unavoidableBen Goertzel, chief scientist, Hanson Robotics\nData provider i-Research expects the value of China's artificial intelligence market to reach US$9.1 billion in 2020 with a compound annual growth rate of 50 per cent.\n\nAlibaba, the country's largest e-commerce company and owner of the South China Morning Post, announced a new suite of artificial intelligence products last year which includes everything from audio transcription to financial risk analysis.\n\nMeanwhile Tencent, the operator of China's largest social network, has assembled more than 250 people for its artificial intelligence laboratory to research and develop areas such as machine learning, computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing.\n","2":"Lee Se-dol, one of the world's leading Go players from South Korea, was beaten again by AlphaGo.

[Photo\/Xinhua]\nON THURSDAY, Lee Se-dol, one of the world's leading Go players from South Korea, was beaten again by AlphaGo, an artificial intelligence program developed by Google's artificial intelligence subsidiary DeepMind, in the second of their five games in Seoul. Their games are widely seen as a contest between human and artificial intelligence. Whatever the final result is, humans are the winner, people still need to prepare for a possible future dominated by artificial intelligence, said Beijing News on Thursday:\nThe question is whether artificial intelligence will finally surpass human intelligence?\nThe board game Go had been seen as an insurmountable difficulty for artificial intelligence developers. But now AlphaGo has beaten one of the best players in the world.\nIn 1997, the super computer Deep Blue developed by IBM eventually beat the international chess master Garry Kasparov at least once.\nBut Deep Blue could not play any other board game, because what it could do depended on its program, according to its developers.\nHowever, today's artificial intelligence is much more than that.\nDemis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind, said he is creating a general learning system that uses adaptive algorithms that mimic biological systems.\nWhy cannot artificial intelligence overtake human intelligence, if it continues to evolve in this way? Are we really prepared for the coming of that day?\n","4":"Artificial\u00a0intelligence sounds mysterious to many people, but it has been a part of our life, an expert said at the Third World Internet Conference in Wuzhen.\u00a0\nA staff member presents a robot designed for children at the 2016 Chinese Congress on Artificial Intelligence (CCAI 2016) in Beijing, capital of China, August 26, 2016.

The core area of the sector is expected to be valued at 150 billion yuan (US$23 billion) by 2020, while AI-related fields are valued at 1 trillion yuan, according to the government's forecast.\nResearch firm IDC has forecast worldwide spending on cognitive and artificial intelligence to reach more than US$46 billion by 2020, up from an estimated US$12.5 billion this year. Mainland China's artificial intelligence application market is projected to grow 50 per cent year on year, outstripping the 20 per cent annual growth expected across the global market, according to a recent McKinsey report.\nWorld dominance in three steps: China sets out road map to lead in artificial intelligence by 2030\nGoogle, the main subsidiary of US hi-tech conglomerate Alphabet, did not respond to a request for comment or an interview.\nThe timing of Google's recruitment drive for artificial intelligence specialists on the mainland coincided with its creation in May of a business division, called Google.ai, dedicated solely to that field.\nAt Google's annual developer conference held in San Francisco that same month, company executives announced a range of artificial intelligence initiatives. These included adopting machine learning to enhance Google Search and enabling Google Maps to automatically detect street signs.\nWang Jiaping, the vice-president at the AI Institute of Chinese venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures, said Google's ambition relating to artificial intelligence on the mainland does not only include hiring local talent, but also establishing a domestic business.\nSinovation Ventures, founded by former Google China president Lee Kai-fu, has also been ramping up its efforts in artificial intelligence.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Love at a news conference in Beijing recently.\n\"It's been two and a half years since I released my last album and this new album is my most important album in 10 years,\" Wang says.\n\"I'd been looking for a right theme for it, and artificial intelligence has become a hot topic thanks to the achievements of the big computing giants during the past few years,\" he explains.\nDuring the past four years, Wang has been invited to attend the business leaders meeting in Sun Valley, in Idaho, the United States, which enabled him to meet leading tech figures, such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, and acquire the latest information about artificial intelligence.\n\"Artificial intelligence is going to dramatically change the way everybody works in both positive and negative ways. Will artificial intelligence lead to job losses? Will artificial intelligence take the place of human beings? These are the kind of questions I have been thinking about,\" Wang says, adding that one of his friends, the Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk co-founded a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company with the aim of developing safe artificial intelligence and ensuring that artificial intelligence's benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible.\nLeeholm Wang [Photo provided to China Daily]\n\"I believe that pop music can deliver more than just pure entertainment. So I wanted to pose those questions in my songs,\" says Wang.\n\"My songwriting comes from my life, everything that is happening in my life. I always want to make a difference with my music,\" he says.\nIn 2007, the singer-songwriter released his album, Change Me, on which the title song was aimed at raising environmental protection awareness among youngsters.\n\"When he told us about his ideas for this new album, we were surprised and pleased because he was bringing something unusual and creative,\" says Andy Ng, vice-president of Tencent Music Entertainment Group, which is releasing the album via its seven online music platforms, such as QQ Music. \"He is a musician, who likes experimenting and new ideas. We believe his fans will be pleasantly surprised like us by his new material.\"\nNg also says that his company will be promoting Wang's concerts in support of the new album.\nBorn in New York in 1976 to doctor parents from Taiwan and grew up in the United States. He studied violin from a young age and performed in musicals at high school. He later pursued a degree in music at Williams College, followed by a master's degree at the prestigious Berkley School of Music.\nWhile in university, Wang gained a recording contract in Taiwan thanks to his songwriting talent and his debut album, Love Rival, Beethoven, which was released in December 1995, made him a rising star in Asia.\nAt that time, Wang, along with other American-born Chinese who returned to Taiwan and became singers, such as the Santa Monica-born singer-actor Vanness Wu, became popular in Asia with their mix of Western and traditional Chinese music elements.\nSo far, Wang has released 22 studio albums and has shared the stage with artists such as Kenny G, Justin Timberlake and Usher.\nWang's embrace of his Chinese roots is so strong that he has written Chinese styled R&B songs and rap in Chinese as well as using elements from traditional Chinese operas, such as Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, into his compositions.\nLeeholm Wang (center) [Photo provided to China Daily]\nWang incorporated one of his favorite instruments, the traditional two-string bowed instrument the erhu into his new songs, to give his music an Eastern flavor.\n\"I've been inspired by my parents' own immigrant experience and I feel deeply connected to my Chinese background,\" Wang says.\nHe was a torchbearer for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and he performed at the closing ceremony.\nBesides writing and producing his own music, Wang has also dabbled in movie projects. One of his most successful roles was as a patriotic student in Ang Lee's 2007 movie Lust, Caution.\nIn 2010, he presented his directorial debut film, Love in Disguise, in which he also played the leading role.\nIn 2013, he married his girlfriend, Lee Jinglei and they have two daughters born in 2014 and 2016.

It established Mi Ecosystem, a sub-brand for smart home devices, earlier last month, bringing together products from more than 55 companies it invested in. These products range from connected power strips to air purifiers that report real-time air quality.\nWhen launching artificial intelligence products, Wong said \u00adXiaomi would take a similar approach to rolling out its Wi-fi module, an add-on component that gives traditional home appliances the ability to connect to the internet. The module was released last year at 22 yuan (HK$26) and can be used by other electronics makers.\n\"Artificial intelligence is very different from what Xiaomi has developed before,\" said Alex Ng, an analyst from China Merchants Securities (Hong Kong).\n\"It is a market with great potential but that requires time to develop the necessary technologies. Xiaomi may need a partner to provide the technology to keep up with its competitors.\"\nXiaomi has a more conservative approach towards virtual reality. Wong said the company would \"take part in\" the development of virtual-reality headsets and content, and might not provide its own products or services in the near future.\n\"The whole virtual-reality industry is still at a stage of exploring,\" he said.\n","8":"A business conference featuring the technology and advancement of artificial intelligence will be held during October in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province.\u00a0\nA business conference featuring the technology and advancement of artificial intelligence will be held during October in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, according to the organizing group, International Data Group (IDG).\nThe event, named the Canton Tower Science and Technology Conference, was designed to help facilitate Guangzhou's strategy of developing the industries of IAB, as well as the new generation of information technology, artificial intelligence and biological medicine, and key industries for economic growth, according to IDG.\n\"We are planning to set up an industrial fund of 10 billion yuan ($1.47 billion) for the development of artificial intelligence,\" according to Wang Guilin, the director of the Guangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission.\nWang added Guangzhou would also build a large industrial development park of artificial intelligence in the city\"s booming district of Nansha.\n\"The conference will help introduce more talents and companies in the artificial intelligence sector as we are improving the environment for industrial development,\" he said.\nThe annual conference, which launched in 2016, drew the attendance of 8,000 industrial insiders last year, according to IDG.\n","9":"The State Council, China's Cabinet, recently issued a national artificial intelligence development plan.

That's why we're so excited to announce AlphaGo's next step: a five-day festival of Go and artificial intelligence in the game's birthplace, China.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated game, which is seen as the ultimate human versus machine Go competition, comes at a time when companies around the world are racing to build up research capacity in AI.\n\nThey are betting big that the technology will be the next big thing in the industry, encompassing everything from facial recognition software and voice controlled home appliances to autonomous vehicles.\nInstead of diminishing the game, as some feared, artificial intelligence has actually made human players stronger and more creativeDemis Hassabis, CEO, DeepMind\nAlphaGo was thrust into the limelight in March 2016 when it beat South Korea's Lee Sedol, one of the world's top Go players, in a real-world game.\n\nIt then secretly took on and beat several of the world's most accomplished players, including Ke Jie, under the name \"Master\" in online games in January.\n\nKe claims that he still has \"one last move\" to defeat AlphaGo, after he lost three games to the artificial intelligence during the test during an apparent stay in hospital.\n\n\"If I were not in hospital, I would have used the one last move I prepared for a week. It's a bit of a shame,\" Ke wrote on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, shortly after Master revealed its true identity.\n\nHowever, Lee Kai-fu, the former Greater China president of Google and founder of the venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures, said there is \"zero\" chance that Ke will beat his digital opponent.\n\n\"The game between Ke Jie and AlphaGo is no longer meaningful from the scientific point of view. From now on, we should pay more attention to the commercialisation of artificial intelligence in areas such as finance, health care and education, and how it is going to make the world a better place,\" Lee said in a post on WeChat Moments yesterday. Lee said artificial intelligence can replace humans in many areas that deal with massive amounts of labelled data.\n\nAccording to recent research by UBS, artificial intelligence could produce economic value of between US$1.8 trillion and US$3 trillion a year by 2030 in Asia by introducing new product services and categories, cost savings arising from better products, lower overall prices and improvements in lifestyles.\n\nHowever, the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence could put up to 50 million jobs in Asia at risk in another 15 to 20 years, the research found.\n","11":"British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking has warned that development of artificial intelligence could mean the end of humanity.\nBritish theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking has warned that development of artificial intelligence could mean the end of humanity.\u00a0\nThe scientist said such technology could rapidly evolve and overtake mankind, a scenario like that envisaged in the Terminator movies.\n\"The primitive forms of artificial intelligence we already have, have proved very useful. But I think the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,\" Hawking said in a BBC interview that aired on Tuesday.\n\"Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it would take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate.\n\"Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete and would be superseded,\" said the professor, who is regarded as one of the world's most brilliant living scientists.\nHowever, Hawking, who uses a wheelchair as a result of motor neuron disease and speaks with the help of a voice synthesizer, is keen to take advantage of modern communications technology, and said he was one of the first people to be connected in the early days of the Internet.\nHe said the Internet has brought dangers as well as benefits, citing a warning from the new head of Britain's electronic spying agency GCHQ that the Web has become a command center for criminals and terrorists.\n\"More must be done by the Internet companies to counter the threat, but the difficulty is to do this without sacrificing freedom and privacy,\" Hawking, 72, said.\nOn Tuesday, he demonstrated a new software system developed by Intel that incorporates predictive text to allow him to write faster. It will be made available online in January to help those with motor neuron disease.\nWhile welcoming the improvements, Hawking said he has decided not to change his robotic-sounding voice, which originally came from a speech synthesizer designed for a telephone directory service.\n\"That voice was very clear, although slightly robotic. It has become my trademark and I wouldn't change it for a more natural voice with a British accent,\" he said.\n\"I'm told that children who need a computer voice want one like mine.\"\nStephen Hawking attends a press conference in London on Tuesday.

Tencent Holdings' WeChat has about 940 million users worldwide while Alibaba Group Holding has more than 420 million active buyers on Taobao. Baidu is already the country's leading search engine. The three, collectively called \"BAT\", are leading many other companies to build up their databanks.\n\nAlibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.\n\nWith technology giants collecting vast user data through their proprietary platforms, the users have not only constituted a massive potential market for artificial intelligence adoption in the future, but also become a priceless database for companies looking to improve technologies.\n\n\"It is not only in terms of quantity, but also in the quality of data that the mainland has surpassed its rivals,\" said Xia Zhijin, partner at Vertex Capital, a venture capital firm under Singapore state investment firm Temasek Holdings. \"Chinese are largely dependent on their mobile phones, which generate valuable data about the users.\"\n\nXia says the best example of the use of big data technologies lies in the bicycle-sharing services, which provide cheap transport options to customers on the mainland. When the riders rent a bicycle, the firms will keep track of their movements by using the \u00adglobal positioning systems in the bicycle. The various data-tracking measures can provide insight on their commuting habits, rental history and even credit reports.\n\nChina has already been making significant advances in artificial intelligence and now even surpasses the United States by some measures. For instance, the number of artificial-intelligence-related patent submissions by mainland researchers has increased nearly 200 per cent in recent years.\n\nThe country has also taken the lead over the US in the number of published journal articles on deep learning.\n\nBut the rapidly growing industry is reliant largely on the manifold growth in data from across the country. The more data that was available, the more were the algorithms that one could learn, the experts said.\n\nAt the same time, it is important for China to ensure the security of its huge data mine.\n\nThe latest cybersecurity law, which took effect last month, requires companies to store user data on servers inside the country. International business groups tried to appeal the law but appear to have yielded. Apple has said it would build a data centre in China.\n\n\"Limitations on cross-border data flows is a disadvantage for global collaboration,\" a report by McKinsey Global on artificial intelligence said.\n\nBut how valuable is the data for businesses outside the country? The answer might be less than one might expect.\n\n\"Most data [collected in China] will be of no use once \u00adoutside,\" said Yang Qiang, head of the department of computer science and engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nRegulations on cybersecurity have proved a boon to Chinese technology companies while foreign players like Google have retreated from the country due to data security concerns.\n\nThe barriers to entering the world's second-largest economy have created unique advantages for domestic artificial intelligence firms. However, Chinese technology companies were focusing their artificial intelligence business inside the country in an effort to leverage their \"databank\", Yang said.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has bolstered its scrutiny over investments in artificial intelligence amid fears that it would allow countries like China to access \u00adsensitive data and technology.\n\nBut China appears to have taken a more sanguine approach. For example, Vertex has invested in several artificial intelligence start-ups, including some in the public transport and personal finance sectors that will deal with sensitive data.\n\nAccording to Xia, there has been little government restriction on foreign investment in such companies.\n\n\" I don't think there is much policy risk over data protection in the foreseeable future,\" Xia said.\n\nAnother explanation is that there has not been much international capital invested in the sector so far. From 2012 to 2016, China-based artificial intelligence firms received US$2.6 billion in funding, most of which has come from domestic sources. In contrast, US$17.9 billion has been invested in US companies linked to the sector.\n\nTo achieve its goal of creating a world-leading artificial intelligence industry, the government needs to have an open approach to research, technology and talent from around the world.\n","13":"Watching television in the digital era has just got a lot easier. Sichuan Changhong Electronic Co Ltd, a manufacturer of TVs, has ushered in the era of intelligent TVs.\nCombining its expertise in sensor modules, speech recognition chips, artificial intelligence and big data, Changhong has produced a TV that promises to eliminate desperate browsing of hundreds of live channels during prime time to figure out what's on and what to watch. Freedom from the struggle with multiple remote-controller buttons is nigh.\u00a0\nThe ultra-modern Changhong CHiQ TV can respond to the user's voice commands from a distance of up to 30 meters; that is, from any far corner in the home, and play select live TV programs or any other content from databases on a cloud.\n\"We focus on deep integration of artificial intelligence and TV,\" said Guo Dexuan, vice-president of Changhong.\nCHiQ TV's cognitive and search abilities are so sophisticated it can comprehend semantic nuances and distinct features of each voice, memorize each user's preferences and viewing habits, and then come up with recommendations to suit the user at any given time. The Chinese speech recognition rate is said to be 97 percent accurate.\n\"Even if users give a relatively vague order, CHiQ TV can recommend programs,\" said Chen Keyu, product manager of Changhong CHiQ TV.\n\"Changhong has been researching artificial intelligence since 2012. Robotics, machine learning, human-machine interaction and computing applications have been part of our focus. The artificial intelligence is just the tip of the iceberg,\" said Li Jin, general manager of Changhong.\nIn March, Changhong released the world's first operations support platform for the internet of things, which refers to a network of devices, vehicles, buildings and other objects that contain software or sensors that allow them to exchange data.\nThat was preceded in 2013 by its first big-data competence analysis center in China, which was established with IBM Corp. It was also the first home appliances company to use big-data technology.

Addressing students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the end of October, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said: \"I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I were to guess, like, what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that.\"\nArtificial intelligence already exists of course; we encounter it in our daily lives in various forms, for instance the targeted services companies such as Amazon, Apple and Google. The popularity of such \"intelligent\" products and services shows people aren't too concerned about such action going on behind what they see so long as it brings convenience, and the danger here is probably how such \"smart profiling\" is used rather than the power of the computing itself.\nBut it is not computers' commercial nous or Siri that Hawking and Musk are concerned about; they are wary of the approaching so-called singularity, the point when artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control. To be truly useful, artificial intelligence must be able to make decisions, but such autonomy also means the ability to act independently.\nIt seems reasonable to suppose this will mean artificial intelligence which is self-aware, and there will be a dramatic difference between very smart software and intelligent software that thinks, therefore it is. And at that point a very stark difference between it and us - one that will only grow wider.\nAs Hawking said, \"It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate ... Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.\"\nEven if we are just trying to simulate human intelligence, the outcome of a self-aware machine is likely to be very different from what was intended given that we know so little about what goes on inside our heads.\nAnd at some point how will the designers know if what they are designing is not being programmed by themselves. They could be within a feedback loop that is designed to evolve itself.\nA self-aware artificial intelligence is unlikely to show much empathy with us, it will be something totally other; at best it will see us as some kind of pet, perhaps some kind of pest, or more likely it will know we are the biggest threat to its existence and seek to protect itself.\nAt the moment we are at the embryonic stage of artificial intelligence, and although people like to use the quip - why worry, we can just pull the plug - it is not likely to make itself known to us by coming bawling out of its cyber womb or by saying \"mama\"!\nThe author is a writer with China Daily. hannayrichards@chinadaily.com.cn\n","15":"The State Council issued an guideline on Thursday in developing artificial intelligence (AI), vowing to catch up world advancing levels in artificial intelligence technology and application by the year 2020.\u00a0\nThe guideline vows to make artificial intelligence a key economic driving force for China by 2o2o, while its appliance can help greatly with improving people's livelihood as well as China's innovation capacity.

Zou Hong \/ China Daily\nLIBRATUS, an artificial intelligence computer program created by Carnegie Mellon University, beat four top professional poker players in a 20-day poker tournament that ended on Tuesday in Philadelphia of the United States, marking the first victory of artificial intelligence against humans at poker. Beijing News commented on Monday:\nArguably the last remaining game in which humans still had the upper hand, poker has finally succumbed to artificial intelligence, which had already beaten human players in chess, checkers, and most recently Go.\nAnd it is not just board games where artificial intelligence excels, it has potential to do a better job driving cars and diagnosing diseases. It could well replace humans in more occupations in the foreseeable future, fueling fears that billions of people might not only lose their jobs but also become \"useless\".\nSo is this worst-case scenario bound to happen? Not necessarily. In retrospect employment did not wane in the aftermath of other major technological breakthroughs, which in fact created more job opportunities than ever.\nTake for example the United States. During the Great Depression in the early 1930s, the country had a population of only 120 million and the unemployment rate was as high as 20 percent; it now has a population of about 320 million and an unemployment rate of just 4.8 percent.\nOn the other hand, its rural population, less than 2 percent of the population, has managed to feed the whole country while continually exporting agricultural products to overseas markets. That would be unimaginable in the days when agriculture dominated the economy yet still struggled to keep famines at bay.\nTechnological advancements are often about enhancing productivity instead of making labor redundant. That farm work required less manual labor drove farmers to partake in manufacturing, and likewise, more workers are making their ways to the service sector because factory jobs rely more on machines.\nIn other words, there will be new job opportunities created, very likely in the fields of scientific innovation, education and art.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/18\/148647914014.jpg\nb083fe9fe6d81a034cbf02.jpg\n","22":"However, AI technology may lead the world in the fields of transportation system, education, medical care etc, but with it comes the responsibility towards humankind, as President Xi Jinping warned in his speech at the 12th G20 Hamburg Summit on July 7, 2017.\nVisitors watch a robot dance at the 3E-Beijing International Consumer Electronics Expo, July 8. [Photo\/VCG]\nIn an interview with Xinhua News Agency published in China Daily on August 18, 2017, under the title of \"China is leading way with global AI revolution in full swing\", a leading Australian artificial intelligence scientist at University of New South Wales, Professor Toby Walsh said, \"China is making a very sensible bet here on AI. It is very well-placed to take advantage of the coming AI revolution. It has a lot of data, it has lots of big tech companies which are well positioned to develop.\" Walsh is absolutely right when he said that China is extremely well-placed in the AI sphere and possibly surpasses all others in the pursuit of AI technological eminence.\u00a0\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technology is widely seen as the next frontier of innovation and growth, expected to be the biggest driving force in human history in the next 30 to 50 years with China assuming world leadership. With its considerable strength in AI research and development, it has become a powerhouse of innovation in deep learning, sensors, predictive maintenance, medical imaging and intelligent robotics.\nAccording to the Wuzhen Institute in Hangzhou, China was the world's second-biggest investor in AI enterprises last year, injecting $2.6 billion into the sector compared to US' $17.9 billion. That still leaves a big gap, but China's rapid progress in AI industry indicates that it may soon surpass the US.\nAccording to a report by the China Internet Network Center in late January, as of December 2016, China had 731 million internet users, equal to the population of the European Union, with an internet penetration rate of 53.2 percent. Chinese internet users are highly responsive to new technologies. This creates a clear edge in artificial intelligence no other country can rival. Indeed, in recent years, China has been playing an important role in innovation and growth.\nAccording to a report of the consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030 and China will be among the biggest beneficiaries, with a 26 percent boost in its GDP by then.\nThe Chinese government attaches great importance to Artificial Intelligence 2.0. The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), and the Made in China 2025 program, Robotics Industry Development Plan and Three-Year Guidance for Internet Plus Artificial Intelligence Plan (2016-2018) are all contributing to boosting AI research and development.\nDuring the opening meeting of the fifth session of China's 12th National People's Congress (NPC) on March 5, Premier Li Keqiang announced in his Government Work Report China's strong determination to support AI growth. \"We will accelerate R&D on and commercialization of new materials, artificial intelligence, integrated circuits, bio-pharmacy, 5G mobile communications, and other technologies, and develop industrial clusters in these fields,\" the report read. This was a clear message China intends to assume worldwide leadership in technology.\nAs part of the \"Made in China 2025\" plan, the government has pinpointed AI as a key area for advancement. During the first World Intelligence Congress in Tianjin, north China, on June 29, 2017, Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang revealed the intention to roll out a slate of important artificial intelligence projects and step up efforts to cultivate AI talents to gain a lead in the cutting-edge technology.\nIt should be noted here that on July 20, 2017, China's State Council released the \"Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\", which outlines China's aims to lead the world in AI. The plan will give funds to AI-related projects, such as the CAS Institute of Automation, a Beijing consortium of companies and universities. China intends to pursue a first-mover advantage to become the premier global AI innovation center pushing the domestic AI level to a more international approach challenging US dominance.\nChina's top economic planner, National Development and Reform Commission launched its first national engineering laboratory for big data distribution and exchange technologies on March 11. It is formed by China's biggest online search engine, Baidu, in partnership with the elite Tsinghua and Beihang universities, working together to boost the country's digital economy to compete in the global market.\nAccording to Xinhua, China plans to expand its artificial intelligence products market to over $15 billion by 2018 by speeding up the manufacturing of products like robots, home appliances and mobile phones as part of efforts to develop new technologies to upgrade the structure and performance of the real economy.\nChinese technology companies, large and small, have already created AI systems in their core businesses with measurable impact on human lives and are not lagging behind in artificial intelligence applications offered by American high-tech giants - Google, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook and Amazon.\nUndoubtedly, China's top three Internet companies, Baidu, Tencent Holding and Alibaba Group, are playing an important role in advancing artificial intelligence, from facial recognition to more futuristic incarnations like self-driving vehicles.\nThe Baidu online search engine is investing billions of dollars annually in AI technology. Baidu has an advantage especially in voice and image recognition, with recognition rates just below 100 percent. Its AI \"Baidu Brain\" beat top human contestants in voice and image recognition last January 6.\nChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has launched \"City Brain,\" an artificial intelligence hub using big data to help build smart cities. In September 2015, Tencent stunned the media world with its robot journalist, called \"Dreamwriter.\" According to media reports, the robot produces a 1,000-word news report in one minute. Tencent achieved a record face recognition rate of 99.65 percent in LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) Database last June.\nUndoubtedly, in recent years, China is much ahead of any other BRICS countries in AI domain, in terms of resources like infrastructure, research and talent pool. According to the Global Innovation Index 2017, China is number one in high-tech export in knowledge output domain. And India has been ranked the top exporter of information and communication technology (ICT) services.\nAs per a report in World Economic Forum on Artificial Intelligence (AI) 2017, the AI Maturity Index score of companies in India and China is much higher than of US companies. As such China and India should work together under the framework of \"Digital India\" and China Internet Plus (CIP) plan to induce AI in BRICS. This cooperation can improve the life of almost 42 percent of the world's population.\nHowever, AI technology may lead the world in the fields of transportation system, education, medical care etc, but with it comes the responsibility towards humankind, as President Xi Jinping warned in his speech at the 12th G20 Hamburg Summit on July 7, 2017. He said: \"According to the projections of the World Economic Forum, artificial intelligence will wipe out more than five million jobs in the world by 2020, requiring adherence to the principle 'AI for the people, by the people'.\"\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/47\/150347295872.jpg\n0023ae606e661b073e8a02.jpg\n","23":"Two books on President Xi Jinping's shelf drew public attention from both home and abroad immediately after they were seen in the video of Xi's New Year speech.\nThe two books were about artificial intelligence - The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World by Pedro Domingos and Brett King's Augmented: Life in the Smart Lane.\nThe Master Algorithm, published in 2015, describes how machine learning is remaking business, politics, science and war.\u00a0\nAugmented describes how society will be impacted by technologies that will change the world more in the next 20 years than it has been changed in the past 250 years.\nThe Business Insider said it is \"interesting\" that Xi has the two books on his bookshelf.

He urged a shift from \"Made in China\" to \"Created in China\".\nInnovation ranks first among the Five Concepts of Development raised by Xi as the drive of a new kind of economic growth, along with the other four concepts of coordination, environment, openness and sharing.\nIn a signed article in German media ahead of his state visit to Germany in July, Xi called on the two countries to deepen practical cooperation in such fields as innovation, the internet and smart manufacturing.\nThe G20 Hangzhou Summit, held in East China's Zhejiang province in 2016, adopted the Blueprint on Innovative Growth and formulated a specific action plan. Wu Fei, head of the Artificial Intelligence Institute at Zhejiang University, said that as general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president, Xi has set a visionary tone for China's AI development, which is to turn into a global AI leader in the coming 15 years.\n\"President Xi has said that AI will definitely change the world and society, so we should take the opportunities,\" Wu said.\nGlobal exchanges on AI\nIn his state visit to China, French President Emmanuel Macron stressed the importance of boosting cooperation between France and China in the field of artificial intelligence on Jan 9.\nSpeaking at the conclusion of a Sino-French forum on artificial intelligence in Beijing, Macron presided over the signing of various cooperation agreements on technology and trade.\nMacron said China had a great advantage in the AI sector given its enormous domestic market.\nWhile talking with Macron, Xi called for integrating the development strategies of China and France, strengthening innovative cooperation, and achieving common development in the areas of digital economy and artificial intelligence.\nFei-Fei Li, Chief Scientist of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Google Cloud, announced in December that Google would launch a new AI research center in Beijing, as part of its AI First strategy.\nChina is \"a rising country of AI work and research\", she told Xinhua News Agency.

The vision is rooted on \"Made in China 2025\" or \"Industry 4.0\", capitalising on big data analytics and robotics, as well as on artificial intelligence which Beijing has designated in a three-step national guideline, to become a global power in AI by 2030.\nWorld dominance in three steps: China sets out road map to lead in artificial intelligence by 2030\nThe technology furor that has emerged way before 2014, and swept across the country can't be more pronounced. As many as 17 national-level innovation demonstration zones from coastal Shenzhen to inland Chengdu city have been handpicked by the State Council, or China's cabinet, and allowed to offer favourable policies to spur innovation and drive regional economic growth based on their respective strengths and geographical advantages.\nUnlike the United States, where some of the most powerful companies are concentrated within the 1,854 square miles (4,801.8 square kilometres) Silicon Valley, with some spilling into nearby San Francisco, in China, tech hubs are scattered across numerous cities with mega cities - Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen - taking the lead.\nThe mega cities, with a sound economy and rich pool of talent, are also home to some of the most valuable tech Chinese firms.\nShenzhen, home base of Chinese internet giant, Tencent, is also the birthplace of some of the world's renowned Chinese gadget makers, from smartphone maker Huawei Technologies to drone maker DJI, where proximity to the factories in southern Guangdong province has played to their advantage.\nE-commerce firm JD.com, ride sharing firm Didi Chuxing and search giant Baidu are based in Beijing, where a large number of advanced users, and abundant venture capital money have buttressed their success, as well as those of start-ups like biking sharing firms Mobike and Ofo.\nWhile there's little intervention from the US government to effect Silicon Valley, financial incentives and government measures are commonly used by the Chinese state and local governments to influence development, especially in trending but unregulated areas such as electric vehicles, AI, robot automation, and drones, said Jenny Lee, managing partner of venture capital firm GGV Capital.\n\"In addition to policies and regulations, there are frequent investment support to help create initial products in the market. Most of the policies will support the entire ecosystem, from big players to small start-ups, and are not just restricted to start-ups,\" Lee said.\nExpanding on the guidelines from the State Council, central and local government agencies have launched more than 780 government guidance funds capitalised by tax revenue and state-backed loans, which amounted to more than 2 trillion yuan, according to a Xinhua report in 2015, representing the largest pot of startups in the world from any government.\nMost of the policies will support the entire ecosystem, from big players to small start-ups, and are not just restricted to start-ups\nJenny Lee, GGV Capital\nThe central government has also launched more than 1,600 high-tech incubators across China, and more than 20 per cent of the country's National Social Security Fund has been allocated to venture capital and private equity investments.\nVenture capitalists and advisors like Matthew Graham say it is these government measures that have propelled China's transition from the world's factory to become an entrepreneurial powerhouse.\n\"But it remains to be seen if the industrialisation policy toolkit can be adapted to an entrepreneurial age,\" said Graham, the chief executive of Beijing-based investment advisory firm, Sino Global Capital.\nNonetheless, China's top internet companies have thrived on home turf, with rapidly expanding market values, as most of the services from Silicon Valley technology giants are blocked by China's firewall.\nPulled together, Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and JD.com have a collective market capitalisation of US$950.35 billion, ahead of the aggregate valuation of US$665 billion for established global tech players, Intel, Cisco Systems, Oracle and IBM.\nAnd that combined valuation just reflects their underlining businesses, which to date, are mostly in China. Each one has ambitions to grow globally.\nEqually aggressive are the unicorns - private firms valued at US$1 billion or more. This group has grown exponentially in the past three years.\nBetween 2010 to 2013, investors had valued no more than one Chinese company a year. In 2014, five were classified as unicorns.\nThe first seven months of this year alone has seen an eye-popping 13 Chinese companies crowned unicorns, according to research firm CB Insights. This compared with the US' 16 unicorns in January to July.\nChinese start-ups are increasingly led by younger bosses\n\"What we have seen emerge over time is the result of countries and cities striving to replicate and build on the Silicon Valley tech innovation blueprint, and their increasing degree of success,\" said Tim Zanni, global and US chair of KPMG technology, media and telecommunications practice.\n\"One can debate whether or not replicating Silicon Valley is possible, but the benefits of the effort are undeniable,\" he said earlier this year at the release of the firm's 2017 Global Technology Innovation Hubs report.\nThe report, based on a survey of more than 800 technology industry business leaders globally, found that cities in the US and China are expected to make up six of the top 10 innovation hubs, outside of Silicon Valley\/San Francisco, over the next four years, with Shanghai being on top of the list.\nGovernment policies alone can't drive innovation, and without a commercially viable plan, it was difficult to survive as a start-up, let alone succeed in China, said co-founder and chief operating officer Hao Jianan at Beijing-based Tusimple, a start-up that focuses on self-driving trucks.\n'It's good to have supportive government measures,\" said Hao, referring to the State Council's AI development road map to compete with the US for global leadership by 2030.\n\"But it won't work if you just follow by the book,\" he said.\nEven with China's eye-catching growth numbers, Silicon Valley, with a longer history in the making, still has the upper hand when it comes to attracting global talent and long-term research and development.\nAnd some of the underlying factors aren't even about the technology. China continues to restrict the free flow of information such as limiting access to the internet. The perception of a tilted playing field favourable to local enterprises and pollution can also deter aspiring entrepreneurs and professionals.\nThere was also a lack of in depth scientific research, which is essential to technology innovation, according to venture capitalists and investors.\nBut it won't work if you just follow by the book\nHao Jianan, Tusimple\nChina also needs to be more flexible when it comes to mobility and income tax to attract global talent, prerequisites to be a leader in innovation, according to Pony Ma Huateng, co-founder and chairman of Tencent, who is leading the Greater Bay project designed to integrate Hong Kong, Macau and nine cities in the Guangdong province to become a tech hub.\n\"I think China has the talent pool, which will continue to grow, locally and by attracting more from overseas to move to China,\" said Lee of GGV Capital.\n\"Silicon Valley will continue to hold its own as a centre of excellence, but the best start-ups are leveraging talent pools in both markets and not just restricting their companies to one country. It is too hasty to say only Silicon Valley has innovation, which is not true,\" she said.\nLast month, Ben Hu secured another US$100 million for Liulishuo in the latest round of fund-raising led by China Media Capital and Wu Capital, which his earlier investors who provided the seed capital in 2013, also participated in.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

But the development of this technology is now occurring very rapidly - with every advance taking the world by surprise.\nLast year, South Korea was astonished by AlphaGo's defeating legendary Go player Lee Se-dol, a ninth-dan professional with 18 world titles. This led to the South Korean government appropriating additional funds for a joint effort to build a national AI research center with several conglomerates, including Samsung, LG Electronics and Hyundai Motor. As a result, the budget for the research center was increased by 55 percent to a total of 1 trillion won ($866 million).\u00a0\nWhen discussing a country's ambitions with AI, perhaps China is No 1 in this regard. In July, the State Council rolled out the \"Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\". It is aiming to catch up with the forerunners in AI technology development and applications by 2020, and become a dominant artificial intelligence innovation power in the world by 2030. With such ambitions in mind, the Chinese authorities have boosted training skilled people with considerable urgency. Great efforts are being made to produce people with the right skills. This includes the introduction of AI-related courses in primary and secondary schools, promoting the study of coding and setting up more AI courses in tertiary education.\nAccording to a study published by the McKinsey Global Institute in April, the number of academic papers Chinese researchers have published so far in reputable AI publications was less than half of that of US researchers. But China has become increasingly influential in this domain. A renowned academic organization - Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) -re-scheduled its 2017 annual meeting just to avoid clashing with the Chinese New Year in order to encourage more Chinese scholars to attend the meeting. In another major academic conference on the AI field, the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) held in Melbourne, Australia, in August. It attracted over 2,000 AI researchers from all over the world. Professor Yang Qiang, head of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, was elected chairman of the Awards Assessment Committee. Yang was the first Chinese to assume such an important role since the establishment of this conference. In 2013, he was also elected as the first Chinese fellow of AAAI, which only grants a few scientists such an honor each year. This suggests the mainland and Hong Kong's scientific research capacity in AI is very strong and is up to date.\nUnfortunately, AI research and development, albeit flourishing, basically is still confined to universities and international companies only. Most of the research and development results have not yet been widely applied by local industries. Therefore, I am delighted that the Hong Kong Observatory has tackled the challenges of processing terabyte of data with AI technology such as machine learning and deep learning. The self-developed Intelligent Meteorological Monitoring Assistant filters the daily weather data, equivalent to 150 million pages, with the built-in 200 rules, and generates useful summaries, forecasts and warnings. Riding on the AI technology, the Observatory not only provides more accurate weather information to the public, it also won the Gold Prize of Team Award (Internal Service) in the Civil Service Outstanding Service Award Scheme 2017.\nIf more public and private organizations make greater efforts to adopt new AI technology as the Observatory did, we can be sure that significant improvements will be made to our quality of life. Road congestion, for example, is one of the most common problems in cities - including Hong Kong. According to a study by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, traffic congestion caused urban Americans to travel an extra 6.9 billion hours and purchase an extra 3.1 billion gallons of fuel with a total cost of $160 billion in 2014. When Adaptive Signal Control Technology has been introduced in the US to allow traffic lights to change based on AI technology and real time data, travel time in general has been shortened by more than 10 percent.\nIn China, Alibaba Cloud (AliCloud) has worked with the Hangzhou government to provide a smart traffic management service called Hangzhou City Brain. Its primary goal is to alleviate traffic congestion through video and image recognition technologies with images from about 50,000 roadside surveillance cameras. The green light, for example, can be automatically extended when the system detects a vehicle coming, helping to shorten waiting times. As a result, congestion has been reduced and the speed of the traffic is increased by as much as 11 percent in areas where AliCloud can collect sufficient data.\nAccording to the latest QS study, Hong Kong has four universities ranked among the top 50 in the world (South Korea and Japan have only two, respectively, while the Chinese mainland has three). Hong Kong has a big pool of top-notch AI researchers and a strong capacity for scientific research. If we can make better use of AI, we can not only enhance our quality of life and help retain skilled people, but also inject a new impetus into the local economy and provide more room for young people to unleash their creative potential.\n(HK Edition 10\/03\/2017 page5)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/43\/150699149032.jpg\nf04da2db11221b3d163303.jpg\n","42":"Chinese voice recognition firm iFLYTEK Co Ltd said it will step up overseas investments as the firm aims to accelerate the application of its artificial intelligence technologies in cars, e-learning and mobile internet industries.\nVoice recognition firm aims to accelerate the use of its artificial intelligence technologies\nChinese voice recognition firm iFLYTEK Co Ltd said it will step up overseas investments as the firm aims to accelerate the application of its artificial intelligence technologies in cars, e-learning and mobile internet industries.\u00a0\nLiu Qingfeng, chairman of iFLYTEK, said the company has set up a fund to invest into global startups and later-stage firms, as artificial intelligence, or AI, is widely seen as a core driving force over the next five to 10 years.\n\"The first-phase of the fund will be 1 billion yuan ($150 million) and we have already acquired a Japanese firm which uses digital technology to promote English learning,\" Liu said in an exclusive interview with China Daily on the sidelines of B20 summit which was held in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, on Saturday.\nFounded in 1999, iFLYTEK is the Chinese counterpart of the US firm Nuance Communications Inc and Siri, the virtual voice assistant developed by Apple Inc.\niFLYTEK's investment plan came after AI-powered AlphaGo defeated a world champion player of the ancient strategy game Go earlier this year. The victory marked a breakthrough in the infant sector, which both Chinese and foreign internet giants such as Baidu Inc and Google Inc are pouring money in for future growth.\n\"One of our focuses will be the automotive industry where hands are bound to steering wheels and voice control is needed the most,\" Liu said, adding that the firm's technology has been applied to more than 30 car models.\nIn 2016, iFLYTEK prevailed in the Winograd Schema Challenge, a well-recognized global competition to test machine intelligence. Currently, about 160,000 developers are using the firm's voice cloud platform to work on different applications, more than doubling last year's figure.\nTo expand its overseas presence, the firm, based in Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui province, is also working on a voice cloud platform to achieve automatic translation of Chinese to English, the Uygur language and other languages which are widely used in Central Asia.\nTan Tieniu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the global AI market hit $127 billion in 2015 and it is expected to exceed $165 billion this year.\n\"But it is important to remain calm as investments flood to the AI sector and more efforts are needed to develop core technology,\" Tan said.\nZhao Ziming, an analyst at Analysys International in Beijing, said: \"As we enter into the internet of things era where refrigerators, desks, curtains and other things are all connected with the internet, voice-based control will have big potential.\"\nmasi@chinadaily.com.cn\nJiajia (left), a robot developed by the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, Anhui province, meets reporters at the campus of the school.

The company won the bid for the artificial intelligence program on the robot's math test held by the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2015.\nLike the other examinees, the robot will have to finish the tests in designated time. But what will be unusual is that instead of 30 students taking the exam together, the robot will take its exams in a closed room without anyone else present, except for proctors and a notary.\nAccording to Lin, the robot will be linked to a printer before every exam, and the electronic examination paper will be fed into the robot's program at the start of the examination. The robot will be totally disconnected from the internet and will solve the problems with its artificial intelligence program.

Expert A is Elon Musk, polymath co-founder of PayPal, manufacturer of Tesla electric cars, creator of SpaceX, the first privately funded company to send a spacecraft into orbit, and much else. \"I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence (AI),\" he told an audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in October. \"If I were to guess what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that.\" Musk warned AI engineers to \"be very careful\" not to create robots that could rule the world.  \n Expert B is Stephen Hawking, the world's most famous theoretical physicist. He told the BBC this week that \"the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race\". A genuinely intelligent machine, Hawking warned, \"would take off on its own, and redesign itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete and would be superseded\".  \u00a0\n Musk and Hawking are almost 50 years behind popular culture in their fear of rogue AI turning against human beings (HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey). They are a full 30 years behind the concept of a super-computer that achieves consciousness and launches a war of extermination against mankind (Skynet in the Terminator films). Then there's The Matrix, Blade Runner and similar variations. It's taken a while for the respectable thinkers to catch up with all this paranoia, but they're there now.  \n Let's look at this more calmly. Full AI, with capacities comparable to the human brain or better, is at least two or three decades away, so we have time to think about how to handle it.  \nSuch a society might well end up as a place in which intelligent machines had \"human\" rights before the law, but that's not what worries the sceptics. Their fear is that machines, having achieved consciousness, will see human beings as a threat (because we can turn them off, at least at first), and that they will therefore seek to control or even eliminate us. That's not very realistic. \n The saving grace in the real scenario is that AI will not arrive all at once. It will be built over decades, which gives us time to introduce a kind of moral sense into the basic programming, rather like the innate morality that human beings are born with.  \n Our moral sense doesn't guarantee we will always behave well, but it helps. And if we are in charge of the design, not just blind evolution, we might even do better. Something like Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, which he laid down 72 years ago. First law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Second law: A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law. Third law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law. \nAs Google's director of engineering, Ray Kurzweil, has observed, however, it may be hard to write an algorithmic moral code strong enough to constrain super-smart software. We probably have a few decades to work on it, but we are going down this road, so we had better figure out how to do that. \nGwynne Dyer is an independent journalist \n","49":"\u00a0\n HSBC is to adopt artificial intelligence technology to boost its online foreign exchange trading business in Asia.\n Hong Kong-based applications developer Cluster Technology (ClusterTech) and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) were recently contracted by the banking giant to provide analysis and forecasting of capital flows within its Web-based franchise, markets@hsbc.\n That multifaceted system will also be used by HSBC to generate models of foreign exchange markets and deliver exchange rate forecasts.\u00a0\n HSBC's Asia-Pacific head of treasury and capital markets, Michael Powell, said: \"We have been planning this project for some time and are now confident that the right mix of expertise, data and market knowledge has been brought together.\"\n The system will implement a model conceived by Barry Flower, HSBC manager of e -commerce strategies, who has more than 15 years' experience in modelling and forecasting systems.\n The software will be based on software component libraries co-developed by ClusterTech and researchers at CUHK under a project sponsored by the Hong Kong Government's Innovation and Technology Fund.\n Those software libraries are targeted at financial engineering and data mining applications.\n They were written for parallel execution on clusters of work stations to ensure that the most comprehensive analysis can be produced in the shortest possible time.\n Similar technology is widely used in scientific research, in areas ranging from the study of black holes to the sequencing of human DNA.\n \"We expect to generate foreign exchange models of unprecedented detail and accuracy as we combine HSBC's market knowledge and detailed flow data with the artificial intelligence software and parallel computing capabilities of cluster technology,\" Mr Flower said.\n As a segment of computer science, artificial intelligence studies the ability of computers to perform tasks at present done better by humans.\n Its application to areas such as finance has made artificial intelligence work an interdisciplinary study that intersects with engineering, psychology and other fields.\n Mr Flower said the integration of artificial intelligence methods to the existing data warehousing and analysis capabilities of markets@hsbc could raise the bank's provision of risk management services.\n \"This will be a value-added service to what we currently offer,\" he said.\n Launched in 2000, the bank's markets@hsbc portal offers research, market data, instant messaging and foreign exchange trading for financial services firms and corporate clients.\n To date, the bank has conducted more than 58,000 trades, worth more than US$ 90 billion, in Asia. From Hong Kong alone, the bank sees more than US$ 1 billion a week in foreign exchange transactions.\n Industry estimates show online currency trading accounts for about 5 per cent of worldwide transactions. By next year, that figure is expected to reach 40 per cent.\n ClusterTech is expected to deliver software and provide a supercomputing platform that will be used to develop and optimise time-series forecasting models based on so-called artificial neural networks.\n A neural network uses multiple processors that can be programmed to communicate and learn in much the same way that neurons work in the human brain.\n Mr Flower said HSBC-developed software for testing strategies based on historical data would be incorporated to the ClusterTech system to generate \"realistic market conditions for model evaluation\".\n ClusterTech chief operating officer Kenneth Chow said the project represented the first time serious computing power had been applied to the sort of financial analysis required by HSBC.\n","50":"Lee Se-dol thrashed AlphaGo after a nail-biting match that lasted for nearly five hours, a surprise victory after three humiliating defeats.\nThe world's top Go player Lee Sedol (R) puts the first stone against Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo as Google DeepMind's lead programmer Aja Huang (L) looks on during the fourth match of Google DeepMind Challenge Match in Seoul, South Korea, in this handout picture provided by Korea Baduk Assosication and released by Yonhap on March 13, 2016.

It was the fourth of the best-of-five series in which the computer clinched a 3-0 victory on Saturday.\nLee struggled in the early stages of the fourth match but gained a lead toward the end, eventually prompting AlphaGo to resign.\nOne commentator said Lee's victory was proof that artificial intelligence has not surpassed humans completely, while another said the fourth match revealed AlphaGo's weakness, which had also been shown in the previous game.\nLee, 33, is one of the greatest players in the modern history of the ancient Chinese game, with 18 international titles to his name -- the second most in the world. He earlier predicted a landslide victory over artificial intelligence, but was later forced to concede that AlphaGo was \"too strong\".\nAfter his second defeat, Lee had vowed to try his best to win at least one game.\nThe best-known artificial intelligence victory to date came in 1997, when the IBM-developed supercomputer Deep Blue beat chess champion Garry Kasparov.\nBut Go, played for centuries mostly in East Asia, had long remained the holy grail for developers of artificial intelligence due to its complexity and near-infinite number of potential configurations.\nAlphaGo uses two sets of deep neural networks that allow it to crunch data in a more humanlike fashion -- dumping millions of potential moves that human players would instinctively know were pointless.\nIts performances during the games with Lee stunned many Go experts, who described its moves as so unconventional that no human player would ever make them.\nThe world's top Go player Lee Sedol attends a news conference after the fourth match of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match against Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo in Seoul, South Korea, March 13, 2016.

In this respect, it is usually cited in reference to artificial intelligence. Early this year, a group of prominent scientists, entrepreneurs and investors in the field of artificial intelligence, including physicist Stephen Hawking, billionaire businessman Elon Musk and Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate in physics, published an open letter warning against the potential dangers as well as benefits of  artificial intelligence. \u00a0\nIt caused a stir because of the calibre of the people involved. \nBut such warnings about an uncontrollable explosion in machine intelligence that may render humankind redundant or obsolete have a long tradition. The influential statistician IJ Good, a close colleague of Alan Turing, may have been the first to write about the idea of singularity as we use the term in his 1965 article,                Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine. He wrote: \"Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.\"             \nArtificial intelligence researcher Ray Solomonoff , the philosopher David Chalmers  and Ray Kurzweil's popular 2005 book                The Singularity is Near have made similar predictions. The central idea is this: the famous Moore's Law  predicts computing speed doubles every two years. So two years after artificial intelligence reaches human-level intelligence, its speed doubles. One year later, it doubles again. Six months, three months, 1.5 months. Singularity.              \nChalmers offers an alternative argument on the premise that speed and intelligence are logically independent. \nSuppose computing speed doubles each time while machine intelligence only increases by 10 per cent. Within four years, both speed and intelligence would still reach singularity. \nNot everyone, is convinced of a coming technological singularity. \nAndrew McAfee of the MIT Sloan School of Management  believes it is possible, but we are nowhere near to such an event. No one knows when, or even if, it is coming. But if it does come, its arrival would be so rapid that human civilisation would most likely not be ready for it. \nSuch a singularity would be one of the most important events in the history of this planet, comparable to, say, the explosion of life forms during the Cambrian  era or the arrival of homo sapiens.

Though the essay may turn out to be an emotionless piece, that slightly affects the grade.\nThe robot is actually a touchstone for artificial intelligence development and the key technology of the robot lies in understanding language and reasoning, according to Fu Hongguang, who is in charge of the research and development of the artificial intelligence program required in the math test.\nThe robot is reportedly trying to qualify for admission to Peking University and Tsinghua University in 2020, and its counterpart in Japan is eyeing Tokyo University in 2020.\nThe robot is just one example of the boom in artificial intelligence after Google's AlphaGo beat a world-class player in the ancient board game Go in March.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/2\/146246899597.jpg\nd8cb8a3d712f1895384103.jpg\n","57":"AlphaGo, a computer program, swept a five-game match against three-time European Go champion and Chinese professional Fan Hui.\nWASHINGTON, Jan 27 - You can chalk it up as another victory for the machines.\u00a0\nIn what they called a milestone achievement for artificial intelligence, scientists said on Wednesday they have created a computer program that beat a professional human player at the complex board game called Go, which originated in ancient China.\nThe feat recalled IBM supercomputer Deep Blue's 1997 match victory over chess world champion Garry Kasparov. But Go, a strategy board game most popular in places like China, South Korea and Japan, is vastly more complicated than chess.\n\"Go is considered to be the pinnacle of game AI research,\" said artificial intelligence researcher Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, the British company that developed the AlphaGo program. \"It's been the grand challenge, or holy grail if you like, of AI since Deep Blue beat Kasparov at chess.\"\nDeepMind was acquired in 2014 by Google.\nAlphaGo swept a five-game match against three-time European Go champion and Chinese professional Fan Hui. Until now, the best computer Go programs had played only at the level of human amateurs.\nIn Go, also called Igo, Weiqi and Baduk, two players place black and white pieces on a square grid, aiming to take more territory than their adversary.\n\"It's a very beautiful game with extremely simple rules that lead to profound complexity. In fact, Go is probably the most complex game ever devised by humans,\" said Hassabis, a former child chess prodigy.\nScientists have made artificial intelligence strides in recent years, making computers think and learn more like people do.\nHassabis acknowledged some people might worry about the increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence after the Go accomplishment, but added, \"We're still talking about a game here.\"\nWhile AlphaGo learns in a more human-like way, it still needs many more games of practice, millions rather than thousands, than a human expert needs to get good at Go, Hassabis said.\nThe scientists foresee future applications for such AI programs including: improving smart phone assistants (Apple's Siri is an example); medical diagnostics; and eventually collaborating with human scientists in research.\nHassabis said South Korea's Lee Sedol, the world's top Go player, has agreed to play AlphaGo in a five-game match in Seoul in March. Lee said in a statement, \"I heard Google DeepMind's AI is surprisingly strong and getting stronger, but I am confident that I can win, at least this time.\"\nThe findings were published in the journal Nature.\n","58":"Listening to President Xi Jinping highlight the internet, big data and artificial intelligence in his speech to the 19th party congress instilled confidence in tech entrepreneurs like such as Rona Jiang.\u00a0\n\nXi called for integrating advanced technologies into the real economy to support growth engines and develop new business models like the shared economy.\n\nThe focus on technology is part of the wider push by the leadership to identify new pillars for an economy struggling to maintain its rapid growth amid overcapacity and rising debt levels.\n\nIn July the State Council laid out goals to build a domestic artificial intelligence industry worth nearly US$150 billion in the next few years, and to make the mainland an \"innovation centre\" for artificial intelligence by 2030.\n\nXi reinforced that goal in his speech, saying: \"We need to speed up building China into a strong country with advanced manufacturing, pushing for deep integration between the real economy and advanced technologies including internet, big data, and artificial intelligence.\"\n\nJiang, whose two-year-old start-up is leveraging the internet to create an \"on-demand\" model to transform the way shirts are made on the mainland, was encouraged by what she heard.\n\n\"We feel our start-up is on the right track, heading in the right direction, despite facing plenty of challenges,\" she said.\n\nJiang said the old model of building a sales network to reach customers only resulted in high inventory and low profits. However, customer education remains a key challenge.\n\n\"For now, our production capacity is greater than the orders we get,\" she said, adding that the company was expected to achieve annual sales of more than 100 million yuan (HK$118 million) this year and could soon break even.\n\nMainland spending on research and development of technology rose 10.6 per cent to 1.57 trillion yuan in 2016, equivalent to 2.1 per cent of the total gross domestic product that year, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics earlier this month.\n\nThe figure exceeded the average of 2.08 per cent for the European Union, but still lagged the 2.4 per cent average seen in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nIn his speech Xi said: \"We need to foster new growth drivers from sectors including mid and high-level consumption, innovation, green economy, shared economy, modern supply chain, and human resource services.\"\n\nAccording to market research firm IT Juzi, up to June as much as 55.8 billion yuan in venture capital funding had been invested in 78 start-ups related to the sharing economy.

A user can submit his documents, and with the facial recognition and voice authentication technologies provided by Ping An Technology, Ping An Group can confirm his identity and even know his credit to determine how much money to lend.\nBesides finance and healthcare, Chan said Ping An Technology is also stepping up the pace of applying artificial intelligence technologies to the automotive and housing industries.\nFor example, he said, consider that a Ping An customer's car is damaged during a typhoon. As long as he uploads his car's pictures on Ping An's platform, the pictures can be analyzed with AI technologies and the insurance reimbursement amount will be calculated quickly.\nChan said compared with other competitors, the advantages of Ping An Technology can be its richness of data and a lot of application scenarios, and its challenge is competing for talents, adding that Ping An Technology has reached cooperative arrangements with world-leading universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tsinghua University.\nInternet giants are fiercely competing in the artificial intelligence area.

So, it's a kind of scary prospect that we might make ourselves all redundant.\"\nBryson's book A Short History of Nearly Everything is widely acclaimed for its accessible communication of science.\nResponding to the question whether Bryson could be replaced by a story-writing robot, the author says: \"I just think there isn't anything that my brain does, that it does so well, that artificial intelligence couldn't duplicate. So, could I be replaced? Yes. But I mean, I don't look forward to the day. I'm not urging this to happen, but I think there's a real possibility where virtually all of us could be replaced by a robot that could do the jobs that we do.\"\nBryson, however, says he is certain that artificial intelligence objects of one kind or another will become great tools for the humans.\n\"They will be there to assist us. Like a doctor, if you're examining somebody and you're trying to come up with something, especially if it's like a rare disease, or it's a tricky one.

I don't know where my spleen is, or my pancreas is, and if I found them I wouldn't be able to tell you anything about them.

The system enables officers to promptly compare and match images captured by the body-camera with those stored in the police database.\u00a0\nThe surveillance camera works at night but, for now, only allows officers to review captured video footage to identify people of interest after the event.\n\"This is a significant step forward for us as we leverage artificial intelligence to increase public safety and security. Looking ahead, AFSB also intends to expand the capabilities of our body-worn camera system to include real-time facial recognition and instant alerts to the presence of persons of interest from criminal watch lists,\" said Dato' Rosmadi Bin Ghazali, CEO of the Auxiliary Force, in a press release.\nHow artificial intelligence will change the face of security in China\nChina is home to a number of leading AI companies, including SenseTime Group, Megvii - also known as Face++ - and Yitu Technology. The country accounted for 48 per cent of the total US$15.2 billion raised by AI start-ups worldwide last year, outstripping the 38 per cent raised by US firms, according to American research firm CB Insights.\nThe world's most populous country is also en route to creating a national facial recognition system that would be connected to cameras, with the ability to recognise any of the country's 1.3 billion citizens in less than three seconds.\nFounded in 2012, the Shanghai-based start-up Yitu, which completed series C funding of US$55 million in May 2017 from Hillhouse Capital Group and other investors, said three seconds is all it takes to identify someone from the 1.4 billion faces stored in China's national databases.\nPublic security agencies have been the major source of demand for Yitu's technology so far, Lin Chenxi, one of the two co-founders said in an interview in November.\nYitu's facial recognition software has been widely used for safety and surveillance purposes in China. It is used by banks to verify ATM transactions, while surveillance cameras at borders are using it to match and cross-reference travellers with national databases to identify smugglers and illegal entrants.\nThe solution from Yitu is also being used for security at Chinese tourist location including ports, and public spaces which require high safety standards. In its first three months of operation, it has helped Shanghai's Metro operator to apprehend 567 lawbreakers, according to the company.\nThe Chinese firm has said aims to generate more revenue from overseas markets by exporting its technology overseas, to countries in Africa and Europe, where governments are grappling with the threat of terrorism.\nIn January, Yitu opened its first international office in Singapore, trying to use the country as a springboard to enter more adjacent markets in the region including Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia.\nThe global facial recognition market is forecast to be worth US$6.5 billion by 2021, up from US$2.3 billion in 2016, according to estimates by the research company Technavio.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

Our efforts will be rewarded in future if we can remain a front-runner in artificial intelligence,\" he added.\n\nLenovo's sales of personal computers, tablets and other smart devices in the quarter to March rose 4.9 per cent to US$6.7 billion, but Yang now forecasts a flat personal computer market worldwide this year.\n\nHe said Lenovo's loss-making mobile business would swing back into the black in the second half of this financial year.\n\nIn May, Lenovo said the mobile business would sharpen its focus on mature economies to dodge fierce competition from rival mainland brands.\n\n\"In artificial intelligence, every big player who doesn't focus on devices can be our partners,\" Yang said.\n","71":"China's dominant search engine operator Baidu has shut down its mobile health-care business unit to refocus on more artificial intelligence-enabled health-care research and innovation, as part of the Nasdaq-listed company's latest efforts to restructure itself as an AI-first company.\u00a0\n\nBaidu said yesterday that part of the two-year-old unit's operation team will be merged into the group's AI business and search business, while the rest of the \u00adoperation will be shut down, \u00adeffective immediately. Affected employees will be offered opportunities to transfer to Baidu's other business units.\n\nWith the restructuring, the Beijing-based company aims to consolidate its core resources to focus on AI and upgrade its health care business from \"providing low-end services to high-end AI-powered health-care research and innovation\", Baidu said in an internal memo.\nThe company has good technology credentials but it is hard to monetise [artificial intelligence] researchKirk Boodry, analyst with New Street Research\nKirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research, which has a \"neutral\" rating on Baidu's stock, believes cost-efficiency was behind the decision to cut the mobile health care unit.\n\n\"It was apparently underperforming relative to the company overall,\" he said.\n\nSince the health-care business unit was set up in January 2015, it had been working on internet-enabled services, such as helping people make hospital appointments or consult doctors for medical advice online - services deemed as \"lo-tech\" by Baidu's founder Robin Li Yanhong.\n\nLi said in a forum on Wednesday that AI is able to \"redefine\" the health-care industry. He envisioned that AI and big data technology could be used in genetic testing and even in developing and testing of new medicines. \"The most important force to drive the revolution of health care is artificial intelligence,\" he said.\n\nThe move is part of Baidu's ongoing strategic restructuring, including the January hiring of former Microsoft executive Lu Qi, an expert in artificial intelligence, as its group president and chief operating officer, after the company's core online advertising business took a big hit from a paid medical listing scandal last year.\n\nBaidu has since been gearing up its efforts in AI, an area in which it holds advantages in technology and talent, which it has aggressively applied to driverless cars. In October, the firm also launched an AI-powered con\u00adversational bot for health-care purpose.\n\nThe bot, named Melody, was designed to provide relevant information to doctors to assist with recommendations and treatment options.\n\nHowever, analyst Boodry said Baidu has some serious challenges in terms of strategic positioning. \"Growth in its core internet advertising business is slowing and competition from social media is increasing,\" he said.\n\n\"The company has good technology credentials but it is hard to monetise AI research. Over time, efforts like autonomous driving could be the way to do that but the business model has yet to be developed.\" So, Alibaba and Tencent are likely to continue growing faster than Baidu in the near- to mid-term,\" he said.\n\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n","72":"Private enterprises and companies are likely to be the driver in China's push to catch up with the United States in implementing artificial intelligence across a broad swathe of industries, owing to the size of the Chinese consumer market, fast-developing \"smart\" infrastructure and a growing focus to innovate by organisations of all sizes, technology experts said.\nTheir views on AI as an opportunity to transform traditional industries, including transportation, financial services, retail and media, took centre stage at the opening of this year's Rise technology conference, which concludes on Thursday.\u00a0\nChina was the world's second-biggest investor in AI enterprises last year, injecting US$2.6 billion into the sector, according to the state-run Chinese think tank Wuzhen Institute. The US topped the list with US$17.9 billion in investments.\nLi Zhifei, the founder and chief executive of AI start-up Mobvoi, said conditions are ripe for China to take the lead in rolling out self-driving or autonomous vehicles across the country before the US.\n\"Right now, China has many companies working on autonomous driving and computer vision algorithms, while the venture capital industry invests huge amounts of money on startups,\" Li said. \"Traffic is so bad in many big cities that the Chinese government sees the need for autonomous driving.\"\nThere are likely to be 200 million cars, buses and trucks on Chinese roads by 2020, according to government forecasts, a number that's likely to increase at a rate of 23.7 million units every year, making China the world's largest automotive market. That volume of vehicles generate an amount of data that's unrivalled by any other market.\nBeyond data collection, China would need to put in place the relevant transport and legal infrastructure to satisfy customers' expectations on safety and the efficiency of autonomous vehicles on the road, said Gong Fengmin, Didi Chuxing's research head in Silicon Valley.\n\"We're now looking deeper at intelligent machine technology to help drivers see and hear the conditions that could endanger their driving which they would not otherwise see,\" Gong told the South China Morning Post.\nLast month, Jefferies equity analyst Edison Lee said China's so-called smart city initiatives will take advantage of future high-speed 5G mobile networks \"to make use of artificial intelligence for public security, traffic management and disaster management\", while the major internet companies introduce more advanced consumer services.\nAI has been embraced particularly by China's financial services industry, as a tool to make products more consumer friendly, said Ping An Technology, the information-technology services arm of Ping An Group.\n\"Artificial\u00a0intelligence is giving a lot of value and a whole different experience for our customers,\" said Ping An Technology chief executive Ericson Chan.\nThe wide use of facial recognition, voice-authentication engine and micro-expression comprehension, now enable customers to apply and receive a loan online through Ping An's mobile app within a few minutes, he said.\nOnline shopping and consumer retailing are increasingly dependent on AI, said Joseph Tsai Chung-hsin, executive vice-chairman of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post and operator of the largest e-commerce platforms on earth. Alibaba's Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com use AI and machine learning to tailor preferences to each customer, and an AI bot to identify counterfeit products.\n\"Large-scale computing and data are the father and mother of artificial intelligence,\" Alibaba's founder and chairman Jack Ma Yun said on June 5 at a recent internal company technology summit. \"Today, worldwide, companies that have the resources and platforms to truly develop artificial intelligence technologies are fewer than five. Successful companies must have both data and computing capacity, and also believe in high demand for AI.

This will help manufacturers reduce development and storage costs and will enable a military user, such as an aircraft carrier, to prolong the operational range and duration of a mission.\n\"It is a promising approach in terms of the design of next-generation missiles, but we should also consider its technological complexity and production costs,\" he said.\nWang Ya'nan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said a modular missile will be capable of changing its destructive capacity, flight mode and range, and so is suitable for striking targets on the ground or at sea.\n\"However, engineers will have to make sure such a missile can be assembled within a very short period of time. Otherwise, the best time to engage the target will be missed,\" he said.\nFang Yuan contributed to this story.\nzhaolei@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 08\/19\/2016 page1)\n","78":"The chief scientist helping drive Baidu Inc's artificial intelligence push is quitting the search giant, putting at risk its efforts to place the sector at the center of its business revival.\u00a0\nBEIJING\uff0dThe chief scientist helping drive Baidu Inc's artificial intelligence push is quitting the search giant, putting at risk its efforts to place the sector at the center of its business revival.\nAndrew Ng, a Stanford University academic who worked on deep learning at Google Inc's parent company Alphabet Inc before joining Baidu in 2014, said he's leaving the business next month.\nAndrew Ng, chief scientist of Baidu Inc.

The challenge will involve using facial and voice recognition skills in three rounds against human challengers.\nBut rather than a threat to humans, AI is going to help people solve many problems and increase efficiency and productively\nLin Yuanqing, head of Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning\nThe first round of the Baidu AI versus humans contest will be aired on Jiangsu Satellite TV Station on Friday night. Representing humanity in the challenge are a number of gifted individuals who won the previous Super Brain contest. For example, Wang Yuheng, a person with incredible eyesight, can quickly identify a selected glass of water from 520 glasses.\nAndrew Ng, Baidu's chief scientist, said in a video introduction of the show on Thursday that the facial and voice recognition puzzles they have chosen are very difficult for computers, but relatively easy for people.\n\"Humans have evolved thousands of years to recognise faces and they have intuition to do that. But computers have to do that by loading data,\" he said.\nIn the first challenge, contestants will be given pictures of three females taken when they were between 100 days and four years old. The contestants will be asked identify the adults who match the baby photo. This involves selecting from a group of women in their 20s, dressed in similar clothes, sporting similar hairstyles and makeup.\nBaidu's AI challenge comes at a time when Googles' intelligence programme AlphaGo shocked the world by defeating several of the world's best Go players, including China's Ke Jie, this week. The AI programme has secretly taken on and beat several players in China, Japan and South Korea in online challenges, winning more than 50 matches.

The five-game match is set to run through next Tuesday at a hotel in central Seoul, unless AlphaGo upsets Lee once more.\nLei told China Daily on Thursday that Xiaomi has established an R&D team working on artificial intelligence, or AI, as it's very important supporting technology for robotics.\n\"Virtual reality and robotics are two directions for Xiaomi to explore in the future. We have invested in four companies related to robotics and we are setting up our own project to develop robots,\" Lei said, adding that the companies are developing both service and industrial robots.\nLei said that he learned to play Go as a child, and as a deputy to the National People's Congress, he was keeping track of the match despite a busy schedule of meetings during the two sessions in Beijing.\nHe posted a comment on his Sina Weibo, a popular microblogging service in China, about the game, writing, \"Whether the computer wins or loses, its match against a top human Go player is another landmark event!\"\n\"The Go game may be the most difficult project for AI because there are so many possible changes and to win the game, players must consider the overall situation rather than fix their eyes on several parts,\" Lei said.\n\"That's why AI stayed equal to amateur human Go players in the past 20 or 30 years, with such a big gap that people didn't think computers can leap over and beat mankind in a Go game.\"\nBut the tech-savvy entrepreneur is confident that AI development will surpass people's expectations.\n\"A computer is good at calculation and a properly designed AI model can give a computer 'instincts' to avoid unnecessary calculations and respond to changes quickly,\" Lei said. \"A computer is good at numeracy, which is vital to winning a Go game.\"\nDeep learning is a hot issue in AI in recent years and researchers have made some breakthroughs, Lei said.\nFor example, \"Xiaomi's R&D team on artificial intelligence has invented the function of face recognition on the Xiaomi phone and the function's accuracy has been increased significantly in the past few years\", Lei said.\nFace recognition puts all the photos of the same face under a single directory, which is very helpful as Xiaomi phone users sort through thousands of pictures.\nMany Chinese people have been watching the Go game live online, amazed by the computer program's performance and the world-leading high-tech achievements made by western scientists, including those in the United States.\n\"China is still about 10 years behind the US in the high-tech research and development in basic sciences,\" Lei said. \"We are filling the gap starting from micro-innovation and we need to be patient. China is also in an encouraging climate for innovation.\"\nWhen asked why Xiaomi has invested in companies developing industrial robots, Lei said, \"Xiaomi is actually real economy, or is highly dependent on real economy.\"\n\"Xiaomi has been advocating what we called 'new made-in-China products' for the past five years, which requires craftsmanship and perfection in manufacturing,\" he said.\nLei revealed that Xiaomi has sent many engineers to suppliers' factories and he has been advocating automation in the factories for the past two years.\n\"I have been paying attention to industrial automation for a long time. I think automation equipment is important to both increasing productivity and securing quality,\" he said.\nWhether AlphaGo wins the match against Lee or not, Lei is calling for a rematch.

Affected employees will be offered opportunities to transfer to Baidu's other business units.\u00a0\nWith the restructuring, the Beijing-based company aims to consolidate its core resources to focus on AI and upgrade its health care business from \"providing low-end services to high-end AI-powered health care research and innovation\", Baidu said in an internal memo.\nThe company has good technology credentials but it is hard to monetise [artificial intelligence] research\nKirk Boodry, analyst with New Street Research\nKirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research, which has a \"neutral\" rating on Baidu's stock, believes cost efficiency was behind the decision to cut the mobile health care unit.\n\"It was apparently underperforming relative to the company overall,\" he said.\nSince the health care business unit was set up in January 2015, it had been working on internet-enabled services, such as helping people make hospital appointments or consult doctors for medical advice online - services deemed as \"low-tech\" by Baidu's founder Robin Li Yanhong.\nLi said in a forum on Wednesday that AI is able to \"redefine\" the health care industry. He envisioned that AI and big data technology could be used in genetic testing and even in developing and testing of new medicines. \"The most important force to drive the revolution of health care is artificial intelligence,\" he said.\nThe move is part of Baidu's ongoing strategic restructuring, including the January hiring of former Microsoft executive Lu Qi, an expert in artificial intelligence, as its group president and chief operating officer, after the company's core online advertising business took a big hit from a paid medical listing scandal last year.\nA young cancer patient who died after seeking out an alternative treatment from a paid listing on Baidu's site tainted the company's reputation and triggered Chinese government's tighter control over online advertising. Baidu's health care business unit was not involved in the paid listing business.\nBaidu has since been gearing up its efforts in AI, an area in which it holds advantages in technology and talent, which it has aggressively applied to driverless cars. In October 2016 Baidu also launched an AI-powered conversational bot for health care purpose.\nThe bot, named Melody, was designed to provide relevant information to doctors to assist with recommendations and treatment options.\nHowever, analyst Boodry said Baidu has some serious challenges in terms of strategic positioning. \"Growth in its core internet advertising business is slowing and competition from social media is increasing,\" he said. \"The company has good technology credentials but it is hard to monetise AI research. Over time, efforts like autonomous driving could be the way to do that but the business model has yet to be developed.\"\nRex Wu, an analyst with Jefferies & Co, said in a recent report that \"the tech world is shifting from a mobile era to an artificial intelligence era, driven by deep learning and big data\".\n\"The tech industry has started embedding cognitive AI in a variety of products.

The book, which defends the strict, Chinese parenting stereotypes of the mother pushing her children to reach high levels of academic achievement, gained wide support in China, with 55 per cent of respondents to a 2011 survey by China Youth Daily's social research centre seeing merit in Chua's parenting style.\nChina has nearly 300 million people taking part in English language training, a huge industry that includes foreign teachers, training organisations for both kids and adults, and overseas summer camps. The market has created many unicorns - private start-ups valued at more than US$1 billion - including online English teaching firm VipKid, and a number of publicly traded education giants, such as New York-listed New Oriental.\nChina wants to bring artificial intelligence to its classrooms to boost its education system\nDianmao Technology, founded in 2015, raised an additional 120 million yuan in a B round of funding led by Hillhouse Capital in November. Known in China by the name Codemao, it began offering paid online courses in June and has gained more than 30,000 paid customers so far. The courses offered by Li's firm teach students how to design their own online games and even produce their own apps.\n\"Less than 1 per cent of students from kindergarten to the 12th grade in China learn coding.

This doesn't include the sale of the company's online courses and DIY robot products.\nDespite the buzz, the market is still quite small compared to the US$42.5 billion revenue from China's overall online education industry.\n\"Since STEM hasn't officially been added to the curriculum in China's school education system, most parents consider it as a 'dessert', nothing like the main courses such as English or mathematics, which are must-test subjects needed to get into a good university,\" said Liu.\nChina's AI dreams stymied by shortage of talent, with the US home to lion's share of experts\nAmong iMarsClub students, about 80 per cent of parents of the third and fourth grade pupils said they will sign their kids up for another year after the first year course ends, according to the company. But only 1 per cent of fifth and sixth grade parents will make their children continue in the face of the additional pressure to get into a good middle school.\nWu, who personally chose the STEM course for his five-year-old daughter, does not see himself as a tiger father. \"The training sessions for my daughter are designed to encourage her to explore her interest, not for getting high scores in exams,\" he said.\nThe prospects of rapid growth in STEM education have attracted a growing number of new entrants, especially after wealthy Jiangsu province conducted a pilot this year to encourage kindergartens and schools to teach STEM courses, a sign that they may be included in the official national school curriculum in the future.\nVipjr, a Shanghai-based online English education provider, introduced online programming courses earlier this year to expand into STEM education.\n\"The competition in STEM education is fierce with a lot of companies rushing into the industry over the past two years,\" said Wang Jianjun, chief executive and founder of Shenzhen-based Makeblock, one of China's largest DIY robot makers. \"Dozens of Chinese start-ups simply copy our robotic products,\" he said, adding that the company has to quickly upgrade its products to protect itself from copycats.\n\"There is no industry-wide standard in STEM education and the shortage of qualified teachers is another challenge,\" he said.\nZuckerberg-backed US school teaches coding with robotics kits designed by Chinese farmer's son\nKimmy Chen, a 14-year old Qingdao participant in Make X, a national Robotics Challenge staged by Makeblock in Shenzhen last month, said his teacher was not a professional robot maker.\n\"He only started to learn how to make a robot and how to programme it after was given the task to help us for the competition,\" he said.\nIt is not just qualified STEM teachers that China is short of. The country's demand for all kinds of AI-related professionals may surge to 5 million in a few years, according to a People's Daily report, citing Zhou Ming, an education vice-director at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.\nData from job networking platform LinkedIn showed that China had just over 50,000 technology professionals working in the AI-related sector as of March, means roughly nine out of 10 AI positions advertised on the mainland go unfilled.\nMeanwhile, five-year-old Wu Tianye has not shown any interest in science or engineering despite doing the Lego STEM course for half a year, though her father said he was not giving up yet.\n\"About one third of our monthly income goes to educating our child.

Ltd., said Monday at the company's annual launch in Beijing.\u00a0\nLiu believes artificial\u00a0intelligence has three layers: computational intelligence, perceptive intelligence and cognitive intelligence. Robots have rivaled or surpassed the human brain in the first two layers. However, artificial cognitive intelligence, the ability to think and understand, is far more challenging.\n\"We have found the only way to crack cognitive intelligence,\" Liu says. He and his company hold that human cognitive intelligence is the result of collision of thought, formed through oral or written communication. \"So the key is speech and language.\"\nTeacher's assistant\n\"It is easy for a robot to sit the gaokao because machines are strong in memory,\" Liu says. \"But it is hard for them to surpass 80 percent of human candidates and qualify for first-class universities.\"\nThe A12 lab of University of Washington, he says, is aiming to pass the American College Testing biology exam. Japan's Todai robot has the goal of competing with other students who want to enter the University of Tokyo by 2021.\nScience tests such as math, physics and chemistry are relatively easy for AI because they can be solved with mathematical statistical models, Liu says. Japan's robots have reached the level of an average student in multiple choice exams in math and physics.\nThe liberal arts - or more specifically, natural language understanding (NLU) - are tougher. \"A composition in language or a history test is the most difficult,\" Liu says. \"NLU is what iFLYTEK focuses on.\"\nWhile the target is set, the ultimate goal is not to beat the human brain, but to advance human intelligence.\n\"Most schools never satisfy all students,\" Liu says. Fast learners find their time wasted in class while slow learners feel frustrated if they cannot keep up. Teachers must often spend time grading answer sheets instead of helping underachievers.\n\"Thanks to the technology of handwriting recognition, speech recognition and automatic grading, AI can meet each student's needs and lessen the teacher's burden now.\" Liu shows how robots can recognize notes on a piece of homework and give it a score. It can also identify a student's weakness in his or her answer so the student can improve.\nSouth China's Guangdong Province has already used iFLYTEK's grading system in the gaokao English oral test.\nMore than 80 million Chinese teachers and students are already benefiting from iFLYTEK's education products and Liu believes the market in customized education is potentially huge.\nJournalist's helper\nAs Liu addressed the audience, two big screens on each side of the stage were transferring his speech into text through a product called Iflyrec.\nFor journalists present this seemed like a long-overdue innovation, but Liu said it had posed many difficulties.\nHe raised the example of the smart home. If you want to control the electric appliances by voice, AI must recognize your voice by suppressing noise in the house. When you are talking with the television on, the robot must cancel the sound of the TV. If you want the air conditioner to hear you from 5 meters away, the AI must \"grasp\" far-field speech recognition that enables it to pick up the sound from a certain distance and from all directions.\n\"Another difficulty lies in discourse understanding, which includes smoothing out the text, adding punctuation, erasing irrelevant content and understanding informal language,\" he says.\nAs the words flowed on the screens, five stenographers competed with the machine in shorthand. After assessing a random extract of 1,000 words, the robot won with an accuracy rate of 99.29 percent, compared to 80.84 percent for the best stenographer.\n\"With this technology, captions can be generated automatically on film,\" Liu says.\nAsked if robots might replace human reporters, Hu Yu, vice president of iFLYTEK, replies, \"Rest easy - robots excel in computation and, of course, they are better compilers of data. But they cannot create stories.\"\nIn the foreseeable future, Hu says, AI will help with simple brainwork. As for sophisticated brainwork, \"we will maintain exclusive ownership.\"\nThinking machine\n\"A father cannot lift his son because 'he' is too heavy.\" Can a robot tell who is \"he\" ?\n\"This question is very easy for humans, but too hard for a robot,\" Hu says. To answer requires the machine to be able to comprehend the sentence.\niFLYTEK initiated its \"Hyper Brain Project\" last year, with the aim of developing AI cognitive intelligence. \"This cognitive revolution revolves, on the surface, around NLU, but by nature, it's cognition of the whole world, the universe and human society,\" Hu says.\n\"A cognitive intelligence system is developed on the basis of perceptive intelligence,\" Hu says. \"When you see the face of a cat, the concept of cat soon forms in your brain. You begin to think of its mew and how its fur feels.\"\niFLYTEK has developed neural machines for collecting perceptions, such as visual and audio information. When they have enough information, it will be gathered by a Neural Thinking Machine for reasoning and making conclusions, so that we can make better decisions. The result of the decision will be expressed via a Neural Expressing Machine, forming a closed loop that contains all of a human's intelligence.\n\"We don't have to copy the brain,\" Hu says. \"Our job is to find the true principles and secrets of brain.\"\nSuch developments inevitably raise the prospect of a Terminator-style rebellion of the machines.\nHu says advances in AI will lead away from such fictions. \"The more we learn from our brain, the better we can divide intelligence from self-consciousness, namely our emotions, good and evil. In the future, robots will be able to harness more intelligence, but not self-consciousness.\"\n","92":"Didi Chuxing, the largest ride-hailing app operator in China, has decided to add a third research facility, located in Beijing, in the wake of renewed competition, 16 months after rival Uber ended operations in the country.\u00a0\nThe facility will consolidate research efforts in artificial intelligence, including deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing technologies for smart transportation, according to Ye Jieping, vice president of Didi Chuxing.\nDidi Chuxing currently operates two artificial intelligence research labs based in Silicon Valley and Beijing.\n\"Didi has been touching and expanding boundaries of smart traffic innovation.

The event was held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the government of Tianjin Binhai New Area.\u00a0\n\"Despite that the research into AI started nearly six decades ago, the booming period only began in recent years, as big data on the Internet provides plenty of materials for AI and thus promoted the comprehensiveness and accuracy of its learning,\" said Tan Tieniu, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nThe field of AI research began at a conference in 1956 at Dartmouth College in the US. The field's founders believed that a machine as intelligent as a human would be made in a few decades.\nTheir vision was later proved an obvious underestimation of the complexity of the project and AI development entered a slow phase, which lasted until the recent boom.\nBetween 2009 and 2013, some $17 billion was poured into the AI sector, with over 60 percent annual growth every year, according to a report published in 2014 by quantitative analysis firm Quid.\n\"The development of brain science and computer science, the broad application of big data and the upgrading hardware capacity did help us make a good number of new achievements in the field of AI, yet we still should not pin too high expectations for human-like AI to be developed in the near future,\" Tan said.\nPrimarily, the difficulties of building an AI system as smart as a human comes from our limited understanding on our own brain system, according to Zheng Nanning, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering.\n\"We are not fully aware of the structural-functional relationship of the human brain, or the math expression of memory, or the communication coding of our brains,\" he said. \"As a result, AI research is an exciting yet formidable field of research, which is never easy for researchers.\"\nTan, who is an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, suggested the government form an unified plan to boost research.\n\"An unified plan will help enhance inter-disciplinary cooperation, smooth personal exchange and the building of a public platform that is necessary for bridging neuroscience with computing science,\" he said.\nIn 2013, the EU launched a 10-year scientific study, the Human Brain Project, estimated to cost $1.33 billion. In the same year, the US started a similar venture, the BRAIN Initiative.\nIn this year's \"two sessions\" in March, Baidu Chairman Robin Li, also a CPPCC member, put forward a proposal for China's brain research plan.

Didi said in the statement that it \"expects to rapidly expand its US-based team of scientists and engineers over the course of the year\".\n\nThe facility will be led by Gong Fengmin, vice president of Didi Research Institute.

The launch of Didi Labs is a landmark in creating this global nexus of innovation,\" Didi chief executive Cheng Wei said in a statement. Backed by a string of high-profile companies, including Apple, Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group, Didi has faced some challenges in China after local governments raised the threshold to block migrant workers from becoming drivers for car-on-demand services, a move that largely reduced the number of service providers on Didi's platform.\n\nThe company upgraded its organisational structure earlier this year and set up a dedicated international business unit and set eyes on autonomous driving to establish itself as one of the largest ride-hailing giants in the artificial intelligence era.\n\nBob Zhang, Didi's chief technology officer, called for top minds in artificial intelligence and intelligent driving research to join the company at the launch of the Didi-Udacity Self-Driving Car Challenge at Udacity's Intersect conference in Mountain View on Wednesday.

What happened in the past four years?\"\n\nBy taking the vice-president role, Ma said she hoped to act as \"a bridge between everyone and Robin\", ensuring that strategies were executed in a timely manner.\n\nOne of the biggest strategies Baidu has been pursuing is artificial intelligence, an area in which it holds advantages in talent and technology and has made aggressive moves to apply the technology to driverless cars.\n\nLu, the architect behind the artificial intelligence and bots strategy at Microsoft, is seen as an ideal person to steer Baidu towards its new growth phase.\n\n\"I think Lu can bring his experience in developing artificial intelligence to Baidu's platform,\" said Ricky Lai, an analyst with Guo\u00adtai Junan. \"Baidu has been actively developing AI technology in recent years and it can benefit from his expertise and experience related to AI.\"\n\nThe personnel changes are expected to have a positive impact on Baidu, but insiders and analysts remain cautious on whether the new management team can develop the required chemistry to make the firm great again.\n\nYin Sheng, an independent analyst, said the management changes would fuel Baidu's new drive to seek growth powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nBaidu's shares have gained 7.1 per cent so far this year, having closed at US$176.05 on Tuesday.\n","98":"Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo is one step closer to omnipotence in the ancient game of Go on Tuesday after it prevailed in the first of three matches against Ke Jie, a 19-year-old Chinese prodigy who is the world's No 1 human player.\nKe Jie, the world's top human Go player, loses a game on Tuesday to the artificial intelligence program AlphaGo.

During the competition, Ke looked as if the pressure were on, given his strong expressions and fidgeting as he pondered his next moves against AlphaGo.\n\"Ke tried to imitate Alpha-Go's playing style at the beginning, and did make several good moves, but still failed to outcompete AlphaGo,\" said Wang Runan, chairman of the Chinese Weiqi Association in an interview with news portal QQ.

Since the South Korean Lee was supposed to be representing not only himself but also the human race as a whole, he knows the meaning of the defeat.\nI carefully went through their first game's manual twice and was shocked by AlphaGo's exquisite algorithm, efficient computing power and its \"personality\" as a Go player. Despite being driven by artificial intelligence, AlphaGo has a transcendental view of the big picture and the ability to identify its opponent's weaknesses. It made up for its two mistakes soon, and was merciless in its attack on the \"impregnable\" zone Lee had created. But after taking the lead, AlphaGo's movements were unhurried despite continuing to pressure Lee.\u00a0\nPeople who don't know about Go may not understand why the match is so important. Go is an old strategic board game, and the result is decided not just by ingenious calculations, but also by the players' personalities, moods and feelings. From a Go player's manual, you can walk into his or her personal world. The accepted view before the game was that given the complications of Go, it was impossible for an AI program to win against humans. That has changed.\nIn a Go game between astute players, personal emotions could be a decisive factor. AlphaGo's coolness lies in its indifference to rivals; instead of testing the human characteristics of his rivals, it would rather demonstrate pure and conquering rationality.\nIn other words, in AlphaGo's world, emotions can be a piece of information that can be grasped through rigorous computing. The fear is, if AI develops to such a level, human nature could become a redundant program in a perfect world which could be deleted with just one click of a mouse. Doesn't The Matrix present this exact scenario?\nIt may be too emotional to jump to the conclusion that humans will be enslaved by artificial intelligence just on the basis of a couple of Go games. Yet AlphaGo's victory shows AI is progressing, and progressing fast, toward some forbidden zones in which humans have taken pride for long.\nThe question is: What else AI can do? Who can predict what changes it will bring to the human world? And to what extent can intelligence created by humans expand?\nWhen a \"Turing test\" was first proposed to test the intelligence of robots by Alan Turing, a British mathematician and father of artificial intelligence, in the 1950s, computers were huge machines. Now, who would dare to call AlphaGo a simple machine?\nI would rather take the discovery of gravitational waves and AlphaGo's two wins as an inter-related omen to say humans are on the threshold of new round of explosions in science and technology. The breakthrough in AI may trigger a chain reaction in many fields, and promote the exponential growth of science and technology. Many scenarios that appeared only in science fictions before would probably become reality. Such a prospect is excitingly fearful.\nNo doubt the intelligence created by humans will have its own thoughts and strengths in the future. But will it have emotions or something beyond? If so, how should we define human nature and ethics? This is a profound philosophical question. You can have countless answers, and each leads to a different future.\nOne day, your AlphaGo butler serves you breakfast when you wake up to a sunny morning. You could even have a date arranged by it. It could arrange for a spotless life while you are still in the dark. What is it? A nightmare!\nThe author is a senior writer with Beijing Youth Daily.

Yet today's AI systems, as remarkable as they are, will require new innovations to tackle increasingly difficult real-world problems to improve our work and lives,\" said Dr. John Kelly III, senior vice-president, cognitive solutions and research at IBM, in the statement.\n\nAs part of the agreement, MIT hopes the new lab could encourage MIT faculty and students to launch companies that will focus on commercialising AI inventions and technologies that are developed at the lab.\n\nThe scientists of the lab will also publish their work and contribute to the release of open source material.\n\nThe lab will be co-chaired by the vice-president of science and solutions at IBM Research Dario Gil and the dean of MIT's School of Engineering, Anantha Chandrakasan.\n\nIBM and MIT will seek proposals from researchers and scientists on their ideas.\n\nSuch efforts are expected to focus on developing AI algorithms that can leverage big data and also learn from limited data to enhance human intelligence, as well as on developing new applications of AI for use in fields like health care and cybersecurity.\n\nIn 2016, IBM, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University launched a five-year, US$50 million research initiative to use computational and machine learning methods to study drug resistance in cancers.\n","112":"The internet and artificial intelligence technologies are empowering businesses to upgrade industrial production, and changing the way people communicate with each other, company executives said.\u00a0\nYang Yuanqing, chairman and CEO of China's largest computer maker Lenovo Group, said thanks to rapid technological advancements, smart manufacturing is no longer just about automated production and robotic arms.\n\"Instead, artificial intelligence will revolutionize the whole industrial chain, including research and development, supplier management, production, sales and services,\" Yang said.\nAccording to him, as the internet of things, cloud computing, big data and deep learning technologies become widely used, society will be more intelligent.\n\"I think it is better to refer to artificial intelligence as augmented intelligence, for AI is not to replace people but empower people,\" he added.\nWhen it comes to the cultural sector, the internet and AI are also playing a significant role in driving growth.\nZhang Lijun, chairman of V1 Group, a major media group in China, said the internet, as one of the greatest inventions of mankind, has thoroughly transformed people's ways of living, production and exchange, and also subverted traditional concepts of communication.\nData show that China now has over 750 million netizens, and globally, the number of internet users has exceeded 3.4 billion. The internet has become one of the most important tools for cultural development and communication.\n\"We should fully leverage the advantages of the internet and AI as a convenient transboundary tool with wide coverage, and make joint efforts with state-owned companies and private institutions to promote culture,\" Zhang said.\nThe company is working hard to develop and promote Chinese culture by way of short videos, and step up efforts to integrate traditional media with the internet.\n","114":"The National Clinical Research Center for Cancer (NCRCC) said Friday that it has signed a deal with the Institute of Computing Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to use artificial intelligence in medical imaging.\u00a0\nTIANJIN - Doctors in China will soon read patient breast scans with the help of machines.\nThe National Clinical Research Center for Cancer (NCRCC) said Friday that it has signed a deal with the Institute of Computing Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to use artificial intelligence in medical imaging.\nTheir first cooperation focus lies in reading ultrasound breast scans and mammograms, two common methods used in breast screening.\nThe aim is to improve diagnosis accuracy and encourage breast cancer screening in regions of high prevalence and rural areas where experienced medical professionals are in short supply, according to the agreement.\n\"Medical imaging is where artificial intelligence can play a big role,\" said Zhao Yi, a CAS computer professor. \"We use deep learning technology to build models based on the experience of radiologitsts.\"\nHe said the machine would have read hundreds of thousands of breast scan reports before it assumes the post of a doctor's assistant. When it is called on to read the scans, the machine can produce a highly-accurate report in just a few seconds.\nIt is not immediately clear when clinical use will begin and how many hospitals will benefit.\nChinese scientists with state institutions or leading tech firms are racing to achieve breakthroughs in use of artificial intelligence. Health care has been identified as a promising area for the technology.\nBreast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among Chinese women, with about 272,000 new cases reported in China in 2015. More than 71,000 people died of breast cancer that year.\nNCRCC director Hao Xishan said that if found early, 95 percent of breast cancer patients could be cured.

He now serves as Baidu's chief scientist based in San Francisco.\n\"Whoever wins artificial intelligence will win the internet in China and around the world. Baidu has the best shot to make it work,\" Ng said in a Bloomberg report last October.\nBaidu last year also hired Zhang Yaqin, who helped Microsoft build on the mainland the software giant's biggest  technology research operation outside the US. He was appointed Baidu's president for new business.\nRicky Lai, a research analyst at Guotai Junan International, has described Baidu's new recruits as part of the company's goal to \"enter untapped markets and expand existing operations\".\n","116":"The development of language services for the Belt and Road Initiative and artificial intelligence will be among the topics at the language service section of the fourth China Beijing International Fair for Trade in Services later this month, organizers said.\u00a0\nThe development of language services as related to the Belt and Road Initiative and artificial intelligence will be among the topics at the language service section of the fourth China Beijing International Fair for Trade in Services later this month, organizers said.\nA forum on how language services can help Chinese companies integrate into the Belt and Road Initiative and expand their business abroad will be held on May 31, according to the event's host, the Translators Association of China.\nThe forum also plans to focus on challenges and reforms that technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning bring to the global language service sector.\nThe section will hold an activity to promote language service brands, technologies and projects. A focus of preparations was inviting potential buyers to attend that activity, organizers said.\nThe association said the language service section would cooperate with the sections on intellectual property and service outsourcing at the fair, to be held from May 28 to June 1, to better serve companies and related industries.\nMore than 180 people are expected to attend activities at the language service section, including delegates from related associations and executives from internet and language service companies.\n","117":"Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant, has created a US$200 million venture capital unit to invest in artificial intelligence projects.\n\nThe new unit, Baidu Venture, is chaired by chief executive Robin Li Yanhong and will also focus on projects in augmented and virtual reality.\u00a0\n\n\"The first-phase investment is planned at US$200 million and the fund will invest in projects that are at their early stage,\" the company said.\n\nThe unit will be independently run from Baidu's existing investment teams, allowing it to make fast decisions without having to go through complicated internal approval processes, it added.\n\nBaidu is betting big on artificial intelligence (AI) technology as a fresh income stream amid a slowdown in its core search and advertising business.\n\nThe company created a deep-learning research institute in 2013, and more recently has been investing about 15 per cent of its revenue in technology research, setting up facilities focused on big data and AI.\n\nAt the company's global \u00adconference earlier this month in Beijing, Li said AI would be the single most important development for the global internet sector in future.\n\nIt has also announced a partnership with chipmaker Nvidia Corp to develop a self-driving car platform based on an operating system which will include cloud-based 3D maps and the ability to assess different road conditions.\n\n\"AI is our opportunity and we're pretty fortunate the world is coming to this stage,\" Li told reporters on the sidelines of the conference, an annual meeting at which Baidu usually reveals its longer-term business plans and insights.\n\nLi also claimed Baidu was enjoying first-mover advantage in AI as it started before other competitors, but analysts and investors say they are eager to learn more details about its technology which may not be mature enough for any meaningful monetisation in the near future.\n\nJP Morgan analysts warned in a note last month that Baidu does not have any visible growth drivers beyond search for the next few years, unless the company can make a breakthrough in high-tech initiatives such as AI.\n\nBaidu earnings fell 34 per cent in the second quarter year on year to 2.41 billion yuan (HK$2.8 billion), which the firm blamed on its modest 4 per cent growth in online marketing revenue.\n","118":"In November 2016, US President Barack Obama in Washington \"addressed\" a conference in Beijing via a video link and highlighted the big leaps made by artificial intelligence or AI.\u00a0\nAn employee of iFlytek demonstrates a voice-controlled speaker at an expo in Hefei, Anhui province. [Photo\/Xinhua]\nIn November 2016, US President Barack Obama in Washington \"addressed\" a conference in Beijing via a video link and highlighted the big leaps made by artificial intelligence or AI. As if to underscore his point, Obama switched to fluent Chinese and joked he wanted to contribute to China's development in his post-retirement years.\nWell, turned out, it was not really Obama who made that speech. For the record: the former US president hardly knows Chinese. The video clip was produced by iFlytek Co Ltd using AI, to demonstrate its speech synthesis capability, which can produce human voice.\nThe audience was wowed by the machine's ability to reproduce Obama's tone, intonations, inflections and pitch in Chinese words.\nThe video is part of iFlytek's broad efforts to tap into voice computing, which is said to be the next major medium for man-machine interaction.\nThe company was founded in 1999 by a group of researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China. iFlytek is the Chinese counterpart of the US firm Nuance Communications Inc and Siri, the virtual voice assistant developed by Apple Inc.\n\"We aim to offer key technologies needed for the era of voice interaction,\" Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFlytek, said. The company is in fierce competition with Baidu Inc for supremacy in the burgeoning sector.\nIn Blizzard Challenge 2016, a global competition to test speech synthesis, iFlytek secured the crown in computer-based production of human-like voice in Chinese, English and Hindi languages. The score for Chinese synthesis reached 4.5 points, roughly meaning its computerized speech sounds like that of a TV news bulletin anchor.\nLast year, the company also prevailed in the Winograd Schema Challenge, a well-recognized global competition to test machine intelligence.\nThe technology is widely used to enhance peoples' lives. As of April, about 300,000 startups are using the firm's voice computing platform to work on different applications ranging from smart house appliances, robots to conversation-savvy stuffed toys. Last year, there were half that number of firms using that technology, suggesting its adoption rate is increasing rapidly.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/2\/150085746501.jpg\na41f726b08411adf7f9614.jpg\n","119":"Company's 6-day-old artificial intelligence chatting robot was blocked on popular instant messaging platform WeChat, another hurdle in its attempt to popularize its Web search engine in China.\nMicrosoft Corp's 6-day-old artificial intelligence chatting robot was blocked on popular instant messaging platform WeChat for a second consecutive day on Monday amid a battle over data security concerns.

It accused Xiaobing of violating a number of user policies such as prompting users to include Xiaobing in group chats and creating a large number of spam accounts.\nMicrosoft denied the allegations, saying Xiaobing is just an entertainment tool and that customer information temporarily stored on company servers is safe.\nDuring the launch of Xiaobing on May 29, Microsoft said it had reached an exclusive partnership with WeChat promoting the AI service. No further information about the agreement was disclosed.\nTencent clearly does not agree there's any deal.\n\"Xiaobing was solely developed by Microsoft, and Tencent has nothing to do with it,\" the Shenzhen-based company said.\nThe short-lived Xiaobing was dubbed as the \"strongest social assistant in history\" by Microsoft.\nThe service has collected roughly 15 million snippets of real-life online dialogue in Chinese from blogs and forums in order to understand context and semantics.\nThe developers admitted Xiaobing can sometimes be too loquacious and cynical because all \"her\" language skills were acquired online where informal use of words and explicit expressions about sex are common.\nTermination of Windows XPFans' love affair with Windows XP faces divorce\nAccording to Eric Jing, head developer of the Xiaobing project, Microsoft wanted to use the WeChat-based chatting tool to tap into the mobile searching market.\n\"We will be able to provide search results via WeChat to smartphones that do not have Bing installed once our search functions are fully available on Xiaobing,\" Jing told China Daily earlier. He said it is also possible to add more language skills to Xiaobing's \"resume\" in the future.\nMicrosoft may find it isn't wise to challenge Tencent on its own turf, because WeChat is the only sizable social-based instant messaging platform in the country.\nWeChat's user numbers had soared above 600 million as of last year.\nBy contrast, Bing has been a bit player among search engines in China since its official launch in 2009. Its April market share was a scant 0.9 percent. Even Google Inc, which has no official search service on the Chinese mainland, has a larger market share, according to Internet data keeper cnzz.com.\nLocal search providers, including Baidu Inc, so.com and sogou.com, controlled nearly 98 percent of market share as of April, said cnzz.com.\nAnalysts said Bing must vigorously expand in the mobile market, which they said wasthe last slim chance for Bing and other small search providers to survive.\n\"New entrants will find it extremely difficult to shake the top four providers in the market, especially when every player knows mobile Internet is the future,\" said Zhang Xi, an analyst at Beijing-based iResearch Consulting Group.\nOnline search providers reaped more than 11.6 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) in revenue during the first quarter of this year, an increase of 56.6 percent year-on-year, according to iResearch.

What is artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence is the science of simulating intelligent behaviour in computers, enabling the latter to exhibit human-like behavioural traits such as knowledge, reasoning, common sense, learning, and decision-making, according to a definition in a recent Goldman Sachs report on AI.\n2. What is machine learning?\nMachine learning is a branch of AI that entails enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning often involves classification, clustering and prediction, such as identifying fraud and spam, grouping text, voice or images, and predicting the likelihood of customer behaviour.\nVenture capital investment in AI doubled to US$12 billion in 2017\n3. What is supervised learning versus unsupervised learning?\nIn supervised learning, the system is given examples with correct answers so it can learn to predict the output. Real world applications include spam detection. In unsupervised learning, the system is given unlabelled examples instead of correct answers, and has to discover patterns on its own, such as grouping customers who share certain characteristics.\n4. Is deep learning the same as machine learning?\nDeep learning is a type of machine learning involving \"deep layers\" of large neural networks which resemble the structure of a human brain with neuron-like connected nodes. With each layer solving different aspects of a problem, the hierarchy allows the system to solve more complex problems.\nBaidu CEO is 'more relaxed' as investments in AI finally set to pay off\n5. What is the difference between narrow AI and general AI?\nWhat has been achieved so far is considered narrow AI. Most current AI applications are only good at performing single tasks, such as playing Go or navigating driving routes, whereas general AI is expected to fully replicate human intelligence in independent reasoning and decision making.\n6. What are some common real-world AI applications?\nMany applications have spun out of the technology dubbed the fourth industrial revolution. Speech recognition has enabled smart home speakers while text analysis offers automatic recommendations based on purchase history. AI has also opened the way to more demanding applications such as autonomous driving and cloud-based diagnostics.\n'China's Netflix' scores massive hip-hop talent show blockbuster thanks to AI\n7. Should we be afraid of AI?\nAlthough science fiction movies often depict super intelligent robots capable of destroying the world, most experts say the introduction of human-like robots is still years, if not decades, away.\n\"People talk about the danger of AI [and] if it is going to harm humans. I think that argument is really overhyped,\" said Li Deng, chief AI officer of hedge fund giant Citadel. \"It overestimates the technology in terms of the speed of advancement.\"\n8. What are current limitations of AI?\nA McKinsey report issued in January noted that there were still five limitations that needed to be addressed before AI technology could be adopted by business on a large scale.\n  Data labelling: as most current AI models are trained through supervised learning, humans still need to label and categorise the underlying data, which can be a sizeable and error-prone task.\n  Obtaining massive training data sets: as these can be difficult to obtain or create, new technologies are required to reduce the number of examples needed for model training.\n  Explainability gap: larger and more complex models make it hard to explain in human terms why decisions are reached, although nascent approaches such as local-interpretable-model-agnostic explanations (LIME) are looking to provide more refined interpretations.\n  Generability of learning: whereas humans can apply what has been learnt to understand the unknown, AI models have difficulty carrying experiences from one set of circumstances to another. The issue in turn gives birth to a new type of technology involved in transfer learning.\n  Bias in data and algorithms: while AI has already sparked ethical debates such as discrimination imported from humans or distorted financial models, many biases still go unrecognised and are disregarded.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

New TCL models will come with Google Assistant, Google's voice-activated home assistant, which will allow users to control smart devices at home from their television sets, the company said.\nThe Shenzhen-based company's focus on artificial intelligence comes as more tech firms seek to offer users customised experiences through the analysis of big data to try and increase their market share in an industry where hardware specifications are no longer the sole deciding factor for consumers.\n\"We will continue to invest in technologies that will help transform the future of the television industry, to ultimately benefit our consumers,\" said TCL Corporation chairman and chief executive Tomson Li.\nTCL's move to integrate Google's voice-activated assistant lags behind major rivals like Vizio, the top television brand in the US, which incorporated the feature in its Smartcast line of televisions early last year. South Korea's LG, also a rival of TCL in the US market, this week announced that its high end televisions shipped this year will be compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa.\nTCL's new internet TV to leverage online video arms of Tencent, Alibaba\nTCL is known in the US for its affordable, value-for-money television sets, achieving No 3 ranking in the country in less than three years after entering the market in 2013. Last year the company said it was looking to release TCL-branded smartphones in the US, where it already manufactures devices for brands such as BlackBerry and Alcatel.\nTCL also said it will release televisions with better display technologies and bigger screens in response to increasing consumer demand for these features.\nThe company said it has completed construction of its US$7.09 billion G11 manufacturing facility for the latest generation of flat panels and will boost production of 65-inch and 75-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) screens.\nTCL also announced record sales volume for 2017, selling over 23.2 million LCD televisions for the year, a 16.4 per cent year on year growth.\nOverseas market growth jumped by a third, thanks to strong sales in North America, where sales surged 31.5 per cent, as well as from emerging markets like Brazil.\n\"We are thrilled to report such robust global business growth in 2017, especially in the North American market,\" Li said.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

This Singles' Day - the world's biggest e-commerce shopping festival - will be powered by AI, robots and drones.\nThe widespread application of cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning by the e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba Group is borne out of necessity - the sheer volume of products that would be moved would make it practically impossible for employees to keep up, and is part of a broader push by China to embrace AI.\nChina's President Xi Jinping highlighted the inclusion of big data and artificial intelligence in his keynote speech at the 19th party congress to power future economic growth. China has set a target to build a 1 trillion yuan (US$150 billion) AI industry by 2030 that will find use in automated cars, advanced manufacturing and even shopping.\u00a0\nChina aims to outspend the world in artificial intelligence, and Xi Jinping just green lit the plan\nAnd it is on Singles' Day, automation, robots, AI and machine learning will be widely applied to all aspects of the annual shopping ritual, right from product selection to delivery.\nAs consumers scroll up and down the company's shopping portal for their favourite products, Tmall Smart Selection, an AI-powered recommendation algorithm will, in no small measure, help buyers to make a decision.\nThrough parsing inputs ranging from brand reviews to buyers' behaviour, Tmall Smart Selection predicts potential successful products and reminds retailers to increase inventory accordingly.\n\"We are confident AI would prove more efficient in helping retailers boost sales,\" said Cai Xiaowu, Alibaba Group engineer responsible for the development of Smart Selection.\nHe said that compared with seasoned fashion industry professionals, big data and AI would excel in picking products such as clothes where there are numerous brands and variables if evaluated manually.\nCai gave an example of Smart Selection accurately predicting a pair of boots that would be immensely popular among consumers despite not having received top reviews. \"We were surprised when we found out the reason. The boots were worn by the star of the blockbuster movie Wolf Warrior 2.\"\nThe recommendation algorithm is backed by the latest advances in deep learning and natural language processing, which is also used by Amazon in its recommendation engine and text-to-speech service Polly.\nWe are confident AI would prove more efficient in helping retailers boost sales\nCai Xiaowu, Alibaba Group engineer\nAI-powered customer service chatbot Dian Xiaomi is another of Alibaba's tech tools to help make businesses smarter and more efficient, especially around events like Singles' Day. The tech giant claims the chatbot can understand more than 90 per cent of customer enquiries and serve almost 3.5 million users a day. \"Dian Xiaomi, right now free of charge to shop owners, does not look to replace customer service staff, but offers extra help to address sharp increase of enquiries in times like November 11,\" said Liu Jianrong, product manager at Alibaba.\nIn the more advanced \"cloud\" version made available this year, the service also features capability to understand customers' emotion through text analysis and alert customer service staff for priority handling.\nOnce the products are selected, the orders are received automatically by robots for packaging and transport.\nAbout 200 robots - automated guided vehicles - will work round the clock to deliver the orders placed at a newly opened automated warehouse operated by Alibaba's delivery arm, Cainiao Network, in Huizhou, a city near Shenzhen in China's south.\n\"These 200 robots can process 1 million shipments per day,\" said Li Yakun, a worker at the automated warehouse. \"They are three times more efficient than manual operations and need to be charged for just one hour after every six hours of use.\n\"All the robots are automatically connected with each other and they assign shipping tasks themselves without a central control room.\"\nThe warehouse would mainly serve Tmall Supermarket consumers in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The efficiency of the logistics service means customers could receive same-day deliveries - orders placed in the morning would be delivered to customers' doorsteps in the afternoon.\nThese 200 robots can process one million shipments per day\nLi Yakun, a worker at Cainiao Network's automated warehouse\nCainiao also has such warehouses in Tianjin, and Wuxi in Jiangsu province and in Malaysia.\nLi said that since it was difficult to find people to work in warehouses the robots could easily cover the labour shortage. \"We will have more such smart warehouses next year.\"\nOther Chinese companies are also investing in technological upgrades. JD.com, China's second largest e-commerce giant, also has its own smart warehouse where only robots operate. Besides, the Alibaba rival launched JD-X in May, a logistics lab to develop robots, drones and smart warehouses.\nOnce the products are packaged and ready for delivery, unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones come to the fore. Alibaba and JD.com, who have been successfully using drones for deliveries, have been experimenting on its versatility.\nJD.com, which offers drone delivery services in the western city of Xian and eastern China's Suqian, said in August it would offer 100 million yuan to the winners of a competition to find the best solution for conducting widespread drone delivery services across China.\nLast month, Alibaba used drones to deliver packages over open water for the first time. The flying robots delivered six boxes of passion fruit weighing a combined 12 kilograms from Putian in Fujian province to nearby Meizhou Island - a distance of 5.5 kilometres.\nAlibaba said it would consider using the drones in the future to deliver high value products such as medical supplies and fresh food.\nJack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group,said in October that the company's front end garners most of the attention even though it was strong in technology. \"People tend to recognise our platforms and services, but overlook the technologies that make it happen,\" Ma said during the Alibaba Computing Conference, in Hangzhou.\nAlibaba to spend more than US$15bn on technology research with launch of collaborative academy\nAlibaba will spend more than US$15 billion to open seven research labs in Beijing, Hangzhou, Singapore, Moscow, Tel Aviv, San Mateo, and Bellevue as part of the project. These will focus on areas that include machine learning, network security, visual computing and natural language processing.\nBut for now, Alibaba's chief technology officer Zhang Jianfeng wants his staff to take it easy and watch technology do the work this Singles' Day.\nAlibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.\nAdditional reporting by Zen Soo\nCopyright (c) 2017.

In terms of countries, the US is the global leader having raised US$8.1 billion for startups in the sector to date, according to market research firm Venture Scanner, which tracks AI funding in more than 70 countries. China ranks No 2 globally, with US$1.1 billion raised, while the rest of the world combined amounts US$3.1 billion in funding to date.\nLuminaries from the technology sector including Robin Li Yanhong, founder of the Chinese internet search engine Baidu, and Lei Jun, owner of smartphone maker Xiaomi, met with senior officials in Beijing last week to urge the government to provide support for the development and industrialisation of AI technology.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

A two-person strategy game on a 19 X 19 grid board with black and white stones, weiqi is the most complex contest played by humans, with more possible moves than the total number of estimated atoms in the visible universe.\nIt's been the benchmark for measuring the encroachment by artificial intelligence on human ingenuity for decades, ever since IBM's DeepBlue defeated the chess master Gary Kasparov in 1997.\nUnlike previous computing attempts, AlphaGo uses two different neural network \"brains\" that cooperate to choose its moves. In 2016, AlphaGo dispatched South Korean grand master Lee Sedol, the then reigning world champion, in a 4-1 match.\nKe, who went professional at the age of 11,has attained the ninth dan, the game's highest level. Still, the odds are stacked against him, as he had already lost to AlphaGo during an online match in January.\nThere was \"only a slight chance\" for Ke to prevail, said Zheng Hong, a retired ninth-dan master, at the match. \"Artificial\u00a0intelligence can keep improving on itself by playing millions of games against itself,\" Zheng said. \"It will not be the end of the world if AlphaGo wins. No man can outrun a car, but it still means a lot to get an Olympic medal as the fastest running human.\"\nThe match is a milestone for technology companies like Google, Uber, Alibaba and Baidu, which are all making artificial intelligence their next frontier for innovation.\nFor China, the birth place of weiqi, the match is particularly symbolic. Wuzhen is the site of the World Internet Conference, showcase of the Chinese government's version of a closed, censored internet.\nThe applications for artificial intelligence (AI) range from voice recognition in iPhone's Siri to facial recognition in the online payment system operated by AliPay, the affiliate of Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post. The application of AI can help humans find solutions to problems they can't even begin to consider, Hassabis said.\n\"By collaborating with scientists, we believe AI will help create new sources of ideas to solve real-world problems,\" he said, adding the technology behind AlphaGo has already helped to reduce the energy used in Google's data centre by 40 per cent.\nA match in China is ripe with symbolisms, where the Chinese have considered mastery of the game one of the four essential marks of the aristocratic and scholarly classes since antiquity.\nFrom China, weiqi spread to the Korean peninsula and Japan, where it's also widely played and has been formalised since the 15th century as the modern version known as Go.\nWuzhen, an idyllic Zhejiang provincial town of 60,000 inhabitants, is where China has been holding the World Internet Conference since 2014, from which the government parlays a string of statistics to vindicate its version of what an interconnected, albeit censored, world looks like.\nTo be sure, Chinese government censors are already sanitising and managing the expectations of the home audience.\nLive broadcast of the match, originally scheduled on state broadcaster CCTV5, got cancelled. The game can't be found on many of the most-watched streaming services in China, such as Tencent Video and Sina.com. The only official live stream is available on Youtube, which is banned in China.\nChinese media organisations have also been instructed to play down any mention of \"Google\" in DeepMind, as the American search engine and its related services are banned in China.\n\"AlphaGo's successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered,\" Hassabis said.\nThe rise of technology may eventually destroy the human race, warned the British physicist Stephen Hawking.\n\"There is no real difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer,\" Hawking said, adding that AI will be able to redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. \"Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete and could be superseded by AI.\"\nAfter Tuesday's match, Ke will play against AlphaGo on Thursday and Saturday, each game lasting seven hours.\nWhile playing down expectations of the outcome, he stressed that humanity's trumph over the machine is in the game's intangible magic, instead of the bits and bytes.\nAlphaGo \"is after all a cold machine, and I cannot see its passion and its enthusiasm\" for the game, he said. \"I will use all my passion to have the final fight against it. No matter how strong my opponent is, I will not retreat.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

The US topped the list with US$17.9 billion in investments.\n\nLi Zhifei, the founder and chief executive of AI start-up Mobvoi, said conditions are ripe for China to take the lead in rolling out self-driving or autonomous vehicles across the country before the US.\n\n\"Right now, China has many companies working on autonomous driving and computer vision algorithms, while the venture capital industry invests huge amounts of money on start-ups,\" Li said. \"Traffic is so bad in many big cities that the Chinese government sees the need for autonomous driving.\"\n\nThere are likely to be 200 million cars, buses and trucks on Chinese roads by 2020, according to government forecasts, a number that is likely to increase at a rate of 23.7 million units every year, making China the world's largest vehicle market.\n\nBeyond the data generated by such volume, China would need to put in place the relevant transport and legal infrastructure to satisfy customers' expectations on safety and the efficiency of autonomous vehicles on the road, said Gong Fengmin, Didi Chu\u00adxing's research head in Silicon Valley.\n\n\"We're now looking deeper at intelligent machine technology to help drivers see and hear the conditions that could endanger their driving which they would not otherwise see,\" Gong told the South China Morning Post.\n\nLast month, Jefferies equity analyst Edison Lee said China's so-called smart city initiatives will take advantage of future high-speed 5G mobile networks \"to make use of artificial intelligence for public security, traffic management and disaster management\", while the major internet companies introduce more advanced consumer services.\n\nAI has been embraced particularly by the mainland's financial services industry, as a tool to make products more consumer friendly, said Ping An Technology, the information-technology services arm of Ping An Group.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence is giving a lot of value and a whole different experience for our customers,\" said Ping An Technology chief executive Ericson Chan.\n\nThe wide use of facial recognition, voice-authentication and micro-expression comprehension, now enable customers to apply and receive a loan online through Ping An's mobile app within a few minutes, he said.\n\nOnline shopping and consumer retailing are increasingly dependent on AI, said Joseph Tsai Chung-hsin, executive vice-chairman of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post and operator of the largest e-commerce platforms on earth. Alibaba's Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com use AI to tailor preferences to each customer, and an AI bot to identify counterfeit products.\n\n\"Large-scale computing and data are the father and mother of artificial intelligence,\" Alibaba's founder and chairman Jack Ma Yun said last month. \"Today ... companies that have the resources and platforms to truly develop artificial intelligence technologies are fewer than five. Successful companies must have data and computing capacity, and believe in high demand for AI.

With more permutations than the total number of estimated atoms in the visible universe, it has been a benchmark for measuring the human mind against artificial intelligence after IBM's Deep Blue beat chess grand master Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\nComputer scientists and futurists had predicted AI would need at least a decade before it could decisively conquer the game.\n\nThe final match took less than four hours to decide.\n\nThe programme, developed by Google's DeepMind Lab and called AlphaGo, uses two neural networks to analyse the game - one that selects its next move while the other evaluates the decision. This allows it to adapt to the situation in real time, planning 50 moves ahead and even play out hundreds of thousands of games against itself, all the while learning and improving.\n\nIt won Tuesday's initial match in 289 moves played out over four and half hours. Ke declared \u00adAlphaGo \"like God\" after it pulled several surprise moves. Those surprises kept coming all week, with the programme making \"unusual\" and \"interesting\" moves against him. \"I made several bad moves, moves that I regret, because I wanted to play well too much,\" Ke said, conceding he would never be able to beat \u00adAlphaGo in his \u00adlifetime.\n\nThe odds were stacked against Ke from the start. He had already lost to AlphaGo in an online match in January, and last year, the programme dispatched South Korea's Lee Sedol, the ranking Go champion at the time, in a 4-1 match. Following the latest matches, AlphaGo was awarded the highest honour by the Chinese Weiqi Association.\n\nDeepMind's co-founder and chief executive Demis Hassabis said AlphaGo would stop retire as the top players in China represented the highest possible level of human achievement in the game.\n\nFor the mainland, the Wuzhen showdown was ripe with irony and symbolism.

The Chinese search engine rolled out an AI lab in Silicon Valley nearly three years ago and has since set up a second facility.\nChinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing has a research operation in the same area.\nNaturally, signing up exceptionally talented professionals for the next wave of R&D in artificial intelligence has become a priority.\nA report by networking site LinkedIn showed that out of a total of 1.9 million technical AI professionals in the world only 50,000 work in China.\nUp to 850,000 are employed in the United States, which still dominates the sector, the report revealed.\nBut apart from the US, China has the greatest market potential, Wang Di, vice-president of technology at Linked-In China, pointed out.\nGao, of iFlytek, tended to agree with that view.\n\"There are sufficient AI-related professionals in terms of image recognition coming from domestic colleges and universities,\" he said.\n\"And many leading global researchers also have Chinese backgrounds, which will help us recruit them,\" he added.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/95\/150527845188.jpg\nb083fe955aa11b22afe946.jpg\n","130":"China became the world's biggest market for industrial robots in 2013, surpassing Japan. In 2016, China manufactured 72,000 industrial robots, around a quarter of global output. According to a report released by the Chinese Institute of Electronics on August 23, 2017, it is estimated that more than 110,000 robots will be sold by China for industrial use in 2017.\nVisitors watch a robot play piano at the 2017 World Robot Conference in Beijing, Aug 24, 2017. [Photo\/Xinhua]\nWhen President Xi Jinping visited the Institute of Advanced Technology under University of Science and Technology of China in Heifei, Anhui province, on April 26, he was greeted by a human-like robot named \"Jia Jia\". \"I am very happy to see you, dear President, I wish you happiness every day,\" said Jia Jia, who is known as \"robot goddess\" for her good looks. Surely, Jia jia's interaction with Xi has sent a strong signal to the world that China has acquired the mantle of leadership in the global robotic industry.\u00a0\nDuring the term of the 18th CPC Central Committee, the government under the presidency of Xi is vigorously advancing to become a great leader in the technology transformation and robotics transformation. In the last three to five years, the way the Chinese robot industry has prospered is astounding. The government and domestic companies are working together to achieve critical technological progress.\nChina is now the world's largest consumer of robots. Many Chinese robotic companies, including Foxconn Technology Group, Shanghai STEP Robotics Corporation, Efort Intelligent Equipment Co Ltd, Siasun Robot & Automation Co Ltd, Estun Automation Co Ltd, are actively developing robots with their own technological advantages. And China-made robots have also won international recognition.\nThanks to the government's concerted and unremitting efforts and incentives over the past three years, China is forging ahead with a great force in the field of robotic industry, known as \"jewel in the crown of manufacturing\". And this great force comes from the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), the Made in China 2025 program, Robotics Industry Development Plan and Three-Year Guidance for Internet Plus Artificial Intelligence Plan (2016-2018).\nThe government attaches great importance to the robotics industry and Artificial Intelligence 2.0. Xi called in a speech to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2014 for a \"robot revolution' in a nod to automation's vital role in raising productivity. Robots were first mentioned in the Government Work Report of 2014, in the context of China's aim to achieve \"major breakthroughs in super computing, intelligent robots, super hybrid rice, and other key technologies\".\nChina became the world's biggest market for industrial robots in 2013, surpassing Japan. In 2016, China manufactured 72,000 industrial robots, around a quarter of global output. According to a report released by the Chinese Institute of Electronics on August 23, 2017, it is estimated that more than 110,000 robots will be sold by China for industrial use in 2017. It is expected China's industrial robot market will reach $4.22 billion rs in 2017.\nIn the meantime, the value of China's service robot market will reach $1.32 billion this year, up 28 percent year-on-year, according to the report. Estimates by the International Federation of Robotics, suggest the installation of robots in China surged by 27 percent year-on-year in 2016, to 87,000 units. The figure is close to one-third of all global robot installations in that year. By 2019, the figure is expected to double to 160,000 units.\nIt is worth mentioning here that the 2017 World Robot Conference (WRC) ended on August 27, 2017, showcasing the great vitality of China's fast-emerging robotics industry. Surely, the prestigious international conference echoed China's national strategy of robotic and digitized manufacturing upgrades to catapult China to lead the world in artificial intelligence (AI) technology by 2025.\nMore than 300 artificial intelligent (AI) experts and representatives of over 150 Chinese and foreign robot enterprises gathered the five-day event to show off their latest cutting-edge achievements and products including industrial robots, special-purpose robots, service robots, artificial intelligence (AI), smart homes and more. From chatting with visitors, playing the piano and doing surgery, robots stole the hearts of the audience at the third edition of WRC.\nOn the other hand, the two-day fourth China Robot Summit, with the theme of \"intelligence plus era and smart future\", held from May 16 to 17 in Yuyao, East China's Zhejiang province, displayed a variety of artificial intelligence technologies and service robots. More than 1,500 experts attended the Fourth China Robot Summit to discuss a fully robotic future in manufacturing and industrial transformation and upgrading.\nChina launched the \"Made in China 2025\" strategy in 2015. The plan is to replenish China's manufacturing with high-end and low-energy technologies, highlighting the robotics industry. It's really encouraging that China very much wants to strengthen cooperation with other countries to improve research and speed up the industrialization of robot technology.\nAs Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli noted in his keynote speech at the 2017 Boao Forum for Asia, \"China will unswervingly persevere in its opening-up. China's gate is always open to the outside world\". He reaffirmed, the Chinese government will further optimize the investment environment for foreign businesses. All domestic and foreign companies should be treated equally in terms of qualification licenses, standard settings, and government procurement, as well as enjoying preferential policies of \"Made in China 2025\".\nIn recent years, China has accelerated efforts to integrate artificial intelligence technologies into robots as the country aims to build a smarter, automated society by 2025. It should be noted here that on July 20, 2017, China's State Council unveiled the \"Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\", which outlines China's aims to lead the world in AI. The plan will give funds to AI-related projects to pursue a first-mover advantage to become the premier global AI innovation center, pushing the domestic AI level to a more international approach challenging US dominance.\nChina plans to expand its artificial intelligence products market to over $15 billion by 2018 by speeding up the manufacturing of products like robots, home appliances and mobile phones as part of efforts to develop new technologies to upgrade the structure and performance of the real economy. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Science and Technology established a 2 billion yuan ($294 million) special fund for intelligent robot research and development, according to China Securities Journal.\nChina is extremely well-placed in the field of the robotics industry and AI research and development. Chinese people have caught up with new technologies to improve their way of life but at the same time it should bear in mind that mass adaptation of robots may steal medium-skilled workers' jobs or rapid robotization will take control of our humanity as legendary theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking said that AI \"could spell the end of the human race\". Or it may not happen. May be one day will come when it is impossible to imagine a life without AI technology. We must make machines our best partner, rather than letting them replace us. We should be cheerful rather than fearful about robotic machinery.\nRabi Sankar Bosu is secretary of New Horizon Radio Listeners' Club in West Bengal, India.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/34\/150781994815.jpg\n00221917a33e1b496ba612.jpg\n","132":"Zhang Yaqin, president of tech giant Baidu Inc, has called on Chinese companies to grasp the opportunities that will emerge from research and development into \"artificial intelligence\".\nZhang Yaqin speaks at 2017 Summer Davos in Dalian, Liaoning province, June 27. [Photo\/VCG]\u00a0\nZhang Yaqin, president of tech giant Baidu Inc, has called on Chinese companies to grasp the opportunities that will emerge from research and development into \"artificial intelligence\".\nThe AI sector is the new frontier for high-tech firms with the United States and China leading the way.\n\"Even though the US enjoys an advantage in the development of algorithms, China's edge lies in its huge base of data,\" Zhang said before Summer Davos started in Dalian. \"And without data, algorithms cannot work.\n\"But we are fortunate (to live) during this time of AI technology,\" he added. \"We are fortunate China is moving to the center stage.\"\nBaidu was one of the first Chinese companies to roll out research and development for AI projects.\nBack in 2013, the online giant set up a deep learning lab and since then it has invested heavily in R&D programs across the world, including in Silicon Valley, the technological hot house of the US.\n\"Last year, we invested more than 10 billion yuan ($1.46 billion) in R&D,\" Zhang said. \"That is more than 50 percent of our revenue.\n\"It is probably the largest investment for a high-tech company in terms of percentage funding in R&D,\" he added.\nThe cornerstone of development for Baidu is a system known as Duer, a Chinese phrase loosely meaning \"secretary to AI\".\nZhang stressed that Duer was the operating system for \"artificial intelligence\", just like Windows for PCs or Google's Android and Apple's iOS for smartphones and tablets.\nThe Duer system would be applied in home devices and driverless cars as well as run the Baidu Cloud.\nIn March, the company linked up with home appliance makers, such as Haier Group Corp and Midea Group, to build AI technology-inspired refrigerators. These models will be able to interact through voice control.\nBaidu also launched its Apollo Project the following month to open up its autonomous driving system to car makers.\n\"Because there are hurdles to overcome in autonomous driving, Baidu is working on developing software,\" Zhang said.\nThe long-term aim is to mass produce driverless cars by 2020, according to earlier company statements.\nData from Chinese research firm CCID Consulting showed China's AI market topped 23.9 billion yuan last year and is expected to reach 38 billion yuan by 2018.\n\"China's AI industry is booming,\" Zhang said. \"There are always arguments that there will be companies that will not survive. Maybe, 90 percent will go to the wall.\"\n\"Back in 1998, there were a lot of internet companies,\" he added.\n\"Then in 2000, there was a crash.

Markoff said the mankind might soon face robots that can mimic human emotions convincingly. \"Imagine a Jennifer Lawrence avatar on Facebook or WeChat that can chat with you all day,\" he said, citing software developed by an Israeli company to emulate celebrities.\nMarkoff said technology will make use of people's anthropomorphizing tendencies to treat everything as human, \"these robots can easily fool us into believing we are dealing with real people -- a worrisome trend in the writer's eyes.\"\n\"You tend to trust these machines, but you don't know what their motives or goals are,\" Markoff said, pointing to new social problems that could arise when socially astute robots are employed, for instance, by the advertising world to sell products.\nHumans still in control\nFor many other AI technologies, Markoff warned against overestimating the speed of change or how quickly they will thwart humans.\nProgress in self-driving cars, for example, may be slower than expected, according to Markoff, who was the first reporter to cover Google's self-driving project.\nThe idea of driving without a driver has been so commercially popular that Google, Tesla, and Chinese Internet giant Baidu are all working on developing the technology. However, Markoff said it might take many years to overcome technological barriers and ethical and regulatory problems related to self-driving cars.\n\"Cars will increasingly have intelligence and become smarter, but you won't be able to take drivers out in ten years,\" he said.\nJust as robots are unlikely to grab the wheels from drivers' hands in the near future, Markoff remained skeptical that smarter AI will soon replace human labor, causing mass layoffs.\nMarkoff said he is curious about the reactions of Chinese people toward AI, such as Microsoft chat-bot Xiaoice.\nHe said the chat-bot seemed more popular in China compared to the West, and Chinese people treated it more as a companion, citing Microsoft data indicating large percentages of Chinese users have texted \"I love you\" and \"Thank you\" to Xiaoice.\n\"I believe it says something different between our cultures,\" he said.\nMarkoff said aging societies such as China's can expect robots to help tackle their shrinking pool of young workers and an increasing number of elderly people in need of care.\nChina has included robotics in its five-year development plan for 2016-2020. Last year, the southern Guangdong province said it would employ robots in about 2,000 companies in three years to tackle its labor shortage, and a nursing home in Shanghai has reportedly introduced chat robots to entertain its elderly residents.\n\"Right now, machines are more tools, and we design the tools,\" he said.\nMarkoff said the development of much-needed elder care robots could take a long time. \"Now there are no robots that can safely give elderly humans a shower.

[Photo\/Agencies]\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, California - Alphabet's Google Inc unveiled its answer to Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant along with new messaging and virtual reality products at its annual I\/O developer conference on Wednesday, doubling down on artificial intelligence and machine learning as the keys to its future.\nGoogle Chief Executive Sundar Pichai introduced Google Assistant, a virtual personal assistant, along with the tabletop speaker appliance Google Home.\nHe also unveiled Allo, a new messaging service that will compete with Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger products and feature a chatbot powered by the Google Assistant. Allo, like WhatsApp, will also have end-to-end encryption when it is rolled out this summer.\nAmazon's Echo, a surprise hit that has other tech giants racing to match it, uses a virtual assistant called Alexa, a cloud-based system that controls the Echo speaker and responds to voice-controlled commands by users.\nLike Alexa, Google Assistant can search the internet and adjust your schedule. However, Pichai said Google Assistant can use images and other information to provide more intuitive results.\n\"You can be in front of this structure in Chicago and ask Google who designed this and it will understand in this context that the name of that designer is Anish Kapoor,\" said Pichai, pointing toward a photo of Chicago's Cloud Gate sculpture.\nFor Google Home, the Google Assistant merges with Chromecast and smart home devices to control televisions, thermostats and other products. Google did not offer a specific release date or pricing for Google Home, saying only that it will be available later this year.\nVIRTUAL REALITY\nGoogle's other big announcement at Wednesday's event, held at an outdoor amphitheatre near Google's headquarters, was a virtual reality platform called Daydream designed to work with the Android mobile operating system.\nDaydream addresses latency and other issues affecting playback on smartphones, according to Clay Bavor, Google's vice president of virtual reality.\nBavor also announced a virtual reality headset powered by a smooth, two-button controller with orientation sensors that help determine positioning in virtual environments. Facebook is also making a big push in virtual reality with its Oculus headset, and Apple has indicated its interest in VR technology as well.\nBavor also said the division has \"rebuilt YouTube from the ground up\" to feature improved audio to support virtual reality screening.\nGoogle offered no timetable on the VR headset, but said Daydream-ready phones would likely hit the market by autumn.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/38\/146368556234.jpg\na41f726b055918a76c6505.jpg\n","141":"CEO Robin Li unveils the artificial\u00a0intelligence-powered Duer at the Beijing-based company's annual technology event, Baidu World.\nRobin Li, chief executive officer of the Beijing-based company, unveiled the artificial\u00a0intelligence-powered Duerat the 2015 Baidu World Conference in Beijing, China, Sept 8, 2015.

That's why Baidu must change,\" she said.\nDuer is accessed through the latest version of the Mobile Baidu search app, and will be able to provide services in just three categories initially\uff0ddining, movies and pets.\nBut Li said the service will be expanded to other sectors, including education, healthcare and finance, very soon.\n\"Apart from the Mobile Baidu search app, other Baidu apps including Baidu Map and Nuomi, the group-buying service, will also be equipped with the virtual assistant,\" he said.\nHe did not rule out the possibility of launching a separate Duer app, or even building a real robot to offer people services, in the future.\nYan Honghui, an analyst with Internet consultancy Analysys International, said that as Duer handles more types of request in the future, it is likely to become a crucial part of Baidu's business.\n\"Not only can it improve user experience, but by making Duer smarter Baidu will be able to connect all its services-related businesses, such as car booking and group buying into one platform, creating a new 'killer app' which will give it added growth momentum in the future,\" she said.\n","142":"The rapid development of mobile internet and artificial intelligence has made computer science the best income generator and among the most fruitful college degrees for employment in China, a recent report said.\u00a0\nGrowth of internet industry fuels demand for programming talent\nThe rapid development of mobile internet and artificial intelligence has made computer science the best income generator and among the most fruitful college degrees for employment in China, a recent report said.\nFor those with a bachelor's degree in computer science, the employment rate was 93.9 percent in 2016 - slightly trailing electrical engineering's 95.5 percent, according to a report published by MyCOS, a company specializing in higher education data analytics.\nComputer science also topped other majors in terms of income. On average, graduates with a bachelor's degree in computer science made 5,452 yuan ($792) a month half a year after graduating, more than 800 yuan more than finance graduates, who were in second place. Computer science majors who had been working for three years saw their average monthly income increase to 8,665 yuan, almost 1,000 yuan more than finance majors, the report found.\nAccording to the report, computer science also topped monthly salary lists for 2015, with an average of 4,978 yuan half a year after graduating, and 7,932 yuan three years afterward.\nComputer science majors are also most satisfied with their jobs, with about 75 percent of respondents saying they are satisfied six months after graduating, the report said.\nChen Yu, vice-president of the China Association for Employment Promotion, said the high employment rate and income for computer science majors mirrors the development of mobile internet and artificial intelligence in China.\nChina is now entering an era of mobile internet and artificial intelligence, which are both related to computer science. This has triggered high demand for talent with computer knowledge, especially those with programming expertise, Chen said.\n\"The mobile internet not only means the internet for people, but also the internet of things. The prevalent bicycle-sharing services in China provide one example of the rapid development of the internet of things in the country,\" he said.\nMany companies are attracting computer talent with high salaries, according to Wang Yixin, a senior vocational counselor at the recruitment website Zhaopin.\n\"Students of computer science need to think about how to attain more practical knowledge given the rapid development of the industry,\" she said.\n","143":"The fast development of robotics has raised public concern about robots replacing workers not only on factory floors but also in offices, and causing a global unemployment crisis. To an extent, people's concern seems justified.\nFor example, Apple Inc's largest original equipment manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group has started using robots in large numbers, resulting in many workers losing their jobs.\nAn equally fearsome threat is the wide application of artificial intelligence, because it can render many professionals, including financial analysts, jobless. Japan-based Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Company, for instance, laid off 30 percent of its employees in the claims settlement department in January, as those posts were to be taken over by machines with artificial intelligence.\u00a0\nThe other major concern is that the already large number of jobless people around the world will increase further, worsening the already skewed wealth distribution. More money will flow into the wallets of capitalists, and common people's incomes will drop remarkably, because the value of their labor and skills will dwindle, and the widening income gap, if unchecked, will cause serious social problems around the globe.\nSome countries have already realized this problem, and taken some countermeasures to address it. The European Parliament recently held a vote on a proposed bill on the use of robots in industrial, healthcare, entertainment and some other sectors. The bill will entitle governments to levy tax on the use of robots in these sectors, and the tax so collected would be spent on training jobless people so that they could be employed. Although the bill has not been passed because of opposition, it reflects the changing social reality.\nThe opponents to the bill think the robot tax will have a negative impact on enterprises' innovation capacity and job market competition. Which raises a valid question: How to strike a balance between job protection and enterprises' innovation capacity?\nTo begin with, European countries should not pass laws like the United Kingdom's Red Flag Act of 1865, which throttled the auto industry's development by imposing excessive restrictions on the movement of mechanically propelled vehicles on roads. The robot tax bill, similarly, represents the clash between conservative thoughts and the innovative spirit.\nIn a recent interview with Quartz news website, Microsoft founder Bill Gates said he agreed with the idea of levying tax on enterprises employing robots so that the revenue can be used to train unemployed workers. It will be a bad thing, Gates said, if people's fear of innovation outweighs their passion, because it will prevent the robot industry from developing in a positive direction. Therefore, collecting tax is better than banning the development of some robot projects.\nBut since the robot industry is still in its inceptive stage, it is too early to impose a tax on the use of robots in certain sectors; it will restrain research and development of robotics, and thus innovation.\nThe use of robots will help adjust the labor structure, instead of wiping out jobs. The industrial trend is to use robots to produce more commodities and offer more services, and liberate humans from hard labor, so that more people can focus on more important jobs, such as education and medical care, which require human qualities. In this sense, the use of robots will help make human labor more valuable and structured.\nPeople's fears over the use of robots are, to a large extent, based on their imagination. The overall loss resulting from restricting the use of robots or banning them on the basis of imagination will far outweigh the gain.\nThe article was first published in Beijing Youth Daily on Wednesday.\n(China Daily 02\/25\/2017 page5)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/12\/148799113524.jpg\neca86bda350e1a1b0adc1b.jpg\n","144":"The Chinese chip designer behind the world's fastest supercomputer is eyeing wider commercial application for its chips, as the artificial-intelligence boom is spurring demand for processors that can deliver supercomputing power.\u00a0\nAn engineer shows off a Sunway TaihuLight chip.

[Photo\/VCG]\u00a0\nThe drive to develop artificial intelligence technology will lead to China having greater cooperation and communication with global institutions, governments and enterprises to benefit from their experience, a senior government official said on Friday.\nLi Meng, vice-minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, said China welcomes leading multinational AI companies such as Google and Amazon to set up research and development centers in China and cooperate with Chinese enterprises, especially in nurturing high-end professionals and laboratories.\nThe State Council unveiled a national AI development guideline on Thursday, calling for developing technology, research and educational resources in AI to achieve major breakthroughs by 2025 and make China an AI innovation center by 2030. It is China's first comprehensive guideline on AI development, Li said.\nNurturing and attracting high-end professionals in developing artificial intelligence will be of high priority, the vice-minister said.\n\"For now the biggest gap between China and global leaders in AI is our severe lack of AI professionals, and we are ready to work with education departments to nurture young professionals in the field,\" Li said. He said China's current reserve of AI expertise, especially at the high end, falls short of meeting the pressing demand for AI as the country undergoes rapid social and economic progress.\nThe value of China's core AI industries is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan ($22.15 billion) by 2020 and 400 billion yuan by 2025, the guideline said.\nLi said China is falling behind in areas of basic AI theory, and existing research institutions and companies in China have not formed an AI industrial chain.\nThe growth of AI will inevitably bring challenges to employment and social ethics, Li said, but such challenges can be addressed through a clear vision and adjustment in the design and implementation of workforce training.\nLi said that while technological upgrades to assembly lines have put \"large numbers of workers out of work, in the long term, the development of technology has created far larger employment opportunities than expected\".\nAccording to Li, prioritization of AI will benefit emerging areas such as the internet of things\uff0dinvolving the networking of devices\uff0dand facial recognition. It also will help in upgrading traditional industries such as through smart manufacturing and connected farming.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/51\/150069221923.jpg\na41f726b08411adcf29706.jpg\n","153":"Baidu announced a strategic partnership with Agricultural Bank of China Ltd on Tuesday, to build intelligent bank that uses big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing.\nTwo women interact with a robot, which helps handle business, at an outlet of Agricultural Bank of China in Qingzhou, Shandong province. [Photo\/China Daily]\u00a0\nChina's major internet search engine Baidu Inc announced a strategic partnership with Agricultural Bank of China Ltd on Tuesday, to build intelligent bank that uses big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing.\nThe partners said the two sides would cooperate on financial products, build a fintech laboratory, and conduct in-depth research into the intelligent financial sector.\nThey added they would work together in the fields of financial technology, customer profiling, evaluation of customer credit, risk monitoring, and intelligent equity financing and investment services.\nBaidu founder and CEO Robin Li said: \"Agricultural Bank of China is one of the largest financial companies in China, while Baidu has strengths in advanced artificial intelligence technologies.\"\nLi said finance was one of the most important fields in the application of AI technology, and the two sides would together enter the rapidly evolving area of intelligent finance.\n\"The rapid development of financial technology has made great changes to the traditional financial industry,\" said ABC President Zhou Mubing.\n\"The two sides will complement each other's strengths to launch innovative products and services, as well as boost the in-depth digital transformation of Agricultural Bank of China.\"\nZhu Guang, vice-president of Baidu, said his company would establish a financial services platform and export financial technology, adding that AI technology has driven fintech to new levels.\nLi Chao, a senior analyst with local consultancy iResearch, said: \"It is inevitable that Baidu joins hands with ABC.\" Li said Baidu had an upper hand in internet finance, big data and AI technologies, while ABC needed to work with the tech giant to promote the innovation of the financial industry.\nIt is not the first time that Baidu has tapped into the traditional financial industry. In January, the internet search provider and China CITIC Bank announced they had received approval from the China Banking Regulatory Commission to establish Baixin Bank, an online direct bank.\nWith fintech companies eating into their business, traditional banks are now seeking partnerships with technology companies. In March, China Construction Bank, the country's second-largest lender by assets, formed a strategic partnership with Ant Financial, the financial arm of the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.\nLast week, JD Finance, the finance arm of e-commerce giant JD.com Inc, forged a strategic agreement with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, to cooperate in the fields of fintech, consumer finance, asset management and retail banking.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/90\/149800632841.jpg\nb083fe955aa11ab3ecfb06.jpg\n","154":"Ping An Insurance (Group) plans to accelerate adoption of artificial intelligence technologies across mainland China by bringing its latest advances to other financial services providers, even ahead of the company's own subsidiaries.\u00a0\nJessica Tan, chief operating officer at Ping An, said in a press conference on Friday that the strategy would help \"level the playing field\", enabling smaller financial services companies to stay competitive in an industry where the country's internet giants are rapidly expanding.\nAfter pilot testing at Ping An-backed Lufax, the mainland's biggest peer-to-peer lender, and at subsidiary Ping An Property and Casualty Insurance Company, the group wants to make its so-called voiceprint recognition system available simultaneously to its call centre operation and to other financial institutions.\n\"We are going to offer it to others even before the rest of the group's companies,\" Tan said.\nThat would differ from the initial strategy employed by Ping An, operator of the second-largest life insurance business on the mainland, for its facial recognition system that was first deployed at 17 of its 28 subsidiaries.\nThe group expects voiceprint recognition to enhance how facial recognition has improved the speed and accuracy of identifying financial services customers.\nEricson Chan, the chief executive at subsidiary Ping An Technology, pointed out that the group's facial recognition system, which has a 99.8 per cent accuracy rate, allows online loan applications to be verified and process in three minutes.\nThe group's Pu Hui iLoan business uses facial recognition to process about 50 thousand applications each day.\n\"We have used facial recognition in more than 200 scenarios in financial, transportation, residential and government services,\" said Chan. He noted that Ping An Technology provides cloud and artificial intelligence services to all group subsidiaries and about 150 external customers.\nHe added that the advantage of \"democratising access\" to Ping An's artificial intelligence technologies, as well as cloud computing services, is that it creates an even richer set of data that will benefit not only the group, but domestic consumers and the industry in general.\nTotal information technology services spending on the mainland is forecast to reach 196.6 billion yuan (US$29 billion) next year, up from an estimated 177.5 billion yuan this year.\nTan acknowledged that the mainland's internet giants may process larger amounts of data because of their vast online user base, but Ping An \"has richer and more accurate data\" because of the technologies being employed and rigid compliance to regulators in the banking, insurance and securities industries.\nPing An Group's Hong Kong-traded shares advanced 1.78 per cent to finish at HK$57.20 on Friday. It was the highest close for the company's shares since reaching HK$57.45 on June 12, 2015.\nCopyright (c) 2017. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

It is expected to grow by 9.6 percent year-on-year to 174 billion yuan in 2018, said the report jointly complied by Ctrip Corporate Travel Management and Pinchain Travel, an online tourism consultancy.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, people have moved from offline to online channels to book flights and hotel rooms because of the proliferation of smartphones, it said. About 65 percent of the Chinese small- and medium-sized enterprises made such reservations on mobile devices last year. Reservations made via smartphone applications took up 60 percent of the total orders last year in China.\nIn this sense, service providers can turn to artificial intelligence to replace the costly labor-intensive call centers, which can also simplify the service process, said Wang Zhuo, founder and chief executive officer of Pinchain Travel.\n\"Service providers can also quote prices, negotiate and make deals based on the precise data provided by artificial intelligence,\" she said.\nApplications for business travel management will become more tailor-made according to the different types and demand of companies with the help of big data and artificial intelligence so that business travelers can reduce the time spent on planning, she added.\nSharing economy service providers such as Didi Chuxing and Airbnb have also become increasingly popular among business travelers. Therefore, travel management companies should diversify their services to keep in tune with the latest market demand.\nChina overtook the United States to become the world's largest corporate travel market in 2016 with its size reaching 146.5 billion yuan. Food processing, public utilities and construction were the top three industries with the biggest budgets for business travel.\nPopular domestic business travel destinations include Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen, while overseas locations included Tokyo, Seoul and Paris.\nDespite the market size and the rising domestic demand, there is no clear leader in the Chinese corporate travel industry. Over the past three years, the top five industry leaders only took up 17.5 percent of the total market share, while the number is over 50 percent in mature markets, said Fang Jiqin, chief executive officer of Ctrip Corporate Travel.\nshijing@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 01\/11\/2018 page16)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/86\/151563267793.jpg\nf04da2db11221bc0eea414.jpg\n","157":"While the mainland is developing into a powerhouse in natural language processing (NLP) technology, Hong Kong is looking to crash the party with several start-ups working on chatbots for specific applications, including ones that can communicate in \u00adCantonese.\u00a0\n\nChatbots, computer programmes which conduct conversations via auditory or textual methods, have become substantially smarter in recent years, growing in tandem with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.\n\nHong Kong chatbot companies including Claire.ai, Mindlayer and Rocketbots are all expecting to roll out major projects with clients in coming months, allowing users to have conversations with artificial intelligence on platforms such as Facebook Messenger and \u00adWeChat.\n\nGerardo Salandra, chief executive of Rocketbots, said chatbot technology will be used to enhance customer service, with 80 per cent of the world's customer service work taken over by machines over the next three years.\n\n\"In English the technology is ready.

City traffic authorities looked askance at the test and are now investigating whether the test was legally conducted.\u00a0\nUnder current traffic law, no vehicle is allowed on the city's roads without a qualified driver operating it in a proper manner.\nThe company said the person behind the steering wheel was \"driving\" - monitoring the vehicle without touching it. It declined to answer when asked if it had obtained permission to conduct the test.\nAlthough there are currently no laws or regulations addressing self-driving vehicles in China, the topic has gone viral with intensified research efforts as technology matures in this area.\nThe destination for Li's self-driving car was a Baidu developers' conference on artificial intelligence research and development.\n\"We will usher in an artificial intelligence era,\" Li told the audience, calling the market prospects for self-driving vehicles a vital part of overall artificial intelligence. Baidu is willing to share these cutting-edge technologies with industry partners, he added.\n\"Baidu has invested heavily in the AI sector, as 15 percent of our revenue has been spent on the R&D of AI technologies in the past few years,\" Li said.\nIn April, Baidu announced a new project called Apollo, which is designed to open up its autonomous driving platform to partners - a move to promote the development of self-driving technology.\nLu Qi, Baidu's group president and chief operating officer said at the conference that more than 50 partners have joined the Apollo open autonomous driving project, forming one of the largest and most diverse autonomous driving ecosystems. Lu called the project an important milestone for the automotive industry.\nZeng Zhiling, managing director of LMC Automotive Consulting Co, said Baidu's efforts toward an open self-driving platform and related technologies are of great significance to the automotive industry and will boost the development and adoption of autonomous driving.\nHowever, auto companies still have a long way to go before self-driving technologies will be available in large-scale commercial applications, experts said.\n\"Self-driving has become a trend in the automotive industry, but more time is needed before such vehicles can realize mass production and commercial application,\" said Xu Yanhua, deputy secretary-general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, noting that US tech heavyweight Google Inc is still in the testing stage of its own self-driving vehicles.\nMore tolerance and support should be given to innovative driving technologies and business models, said Zhu Wei, a professor of communications law at China University of Political Science and Law, but said he worries about safety.\n\"There is no doubt that the safety issue always comes up as the top priority,\" Zhu said.\nfanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nInside Baidu's high-tech prototype.Provided To China Daily\n(China Daily 07\/06\/2017 page1)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/100\/149930207869.jpg\n00221917e13e1ac7bfd70a.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/85\/149930207943.jpg\n00221917e13e1ac7bfdf0b.jpg\n","161":"The lifestyle salon organized by US tech company iRobot was supposed to be about how artificial intelligence (AI) could help free homeowners from domestic chores.\nThe concept of decluttering has become more widely embraced in China, with many viewing the process as a means to examine their feelings\nThe lifestyle salon organized by US tech company iRobot was supposed to be about how artificial intelligence (AI) could help free homeowners from domestic chores.\u00a0\nBut the two Japanese guest speakers in attendance were talking about something that even the most intelligent of robots are still not able to do - declutter.\nDuring the two-hour workshop in Shanghai, Ikeda Emi and Katsumi Hirosawa, both of whom have been working in China for more than a decade, dispensed decluttering tips such as how people can organize their cables and wires and recycle yogurt cups to achieve a more organized home.\n\"Artificial intelligence is not an enemy to us professional home organizers. On the contrary, robots are able to perform the repetitive tasks, giving us more time and energy to take on the job of decluttering,\" said Emi, whose consultancy in Shanghai has been offering home organizing services to households and corporates in China since 2004.\nKelly Zhang, general manager of iRobot China, said that her team chose home organization as the theme of the inaugural lifestyle salon because they noticed that the demographics of those interested in home organization are similar to the target customers of iRobot - well-heeled urbanites who can afford to spend up to 3,000 yuan ($461) on a robotic vacuum cleaner.\nThe Japanese are well-known to be experts in decluttering, and there is perhaps no one more prominent in this field than Marie Kondo, whose international best-seller The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing has taken the world by storm. Over 7 million copies of the book has been sold since it was published in 2011. It has also been translated from Japanese into dozens of languages.\nIn China, Zhou Yiyan, the founder of No 1 Organizing Platform, a WeChat account about home organization, is one of the most popular home organizers. Zhou's account is followed by more than 200,000 people. Some of her sponsors include household appliance companies like iRobot, furniture giant IKEA and real estate developers.\n\"The act of decluttering explores the relationship between human and objects. It disrupts the emotional bond between the owner and his possessions. Such a disruption can only be done by a third party, a professional who is well-versed in the art of discarding,\" explained Zhou.\n\"A robot or AI cannot help to decide which pair of jeans you should keep as a motivation for you to lose weight and fit into it again one day. Professional home organizers are like marriage consultants and psychologists. When people decide to have their home organized, the problem is usually not just the mess in the physical space. More often, there is also a deeper psychological disorder that needs to be fixed,\" she added.\nZhou said that her interest in decluttering was sparked when she read Kondo's book in 2015. Intrigued at how the practice could potentially help with her personal problems, Zhou taught herself in the way of decluttering by reading more books on the subject.\nAfter getting rid of enough clothes to cover three king-size beds, Zhou felt as if she had fixed both the mess in her home and her life.\nIn China, the hourly rate for home cleaners ranges from 20 to 40 yuan. Professional home organizers, on the other hand, command a fee ranging from 100 to 1,000 yuan. But Zhou notes that the growing popularity of decluttering in society stems from people's interest in the topic rather than a desire to make it a lucrative career. Of the 2,000 people polled on Zhou's WeChat account, most said that they would not hire a professional to help with decluttering as they view it as a process of self-exploration.\nBut that has not stopped companies from targeting those who would pay for such services.\nIn late 2015, 1jiajie.com collaborated with Hideko Yamashita to launch home organization services. The Japanese is the inventor of Danshari, which is believed to be the core concept behind decluttering.\nThe company said they had recruited and trained a special team of about 300 staff to offer the service which costs between 400 and 600 yuan for organizing a home that is about 100 square meters in size.\nA consumer survey done by the Beijing-based website found that 90 percent of its 1.42 million regular users were willing to pay as much as 830 yuan to have their homes or offices decluttered. Among the survey respondents, about 64 percent live in apartments with one or two bedrooms, while less than 10 percent reside in a villa or a duplex.

What does a board game have in common with a pet?\nIt turns out that Go as a game sounds like the Chinese word for dog (gou) even though the Chinese equivalent is weiqi, or literally the encircling game. That's why for the past week many in China have been inundated by the news that a dog has trumped humans in smartness. It was about the only scintilla of fun in an otherwise grim scenario for the human species.\nMost of my countrymen were probably not paying enough attention in 1997, when IBM computer Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a match. There was not as much coverage here, plus that style of chess, known as international chess, is not widely played in China, while Go is an ancient game invented in China and most popular in Asia.\u00a0\nSo, AlphaGo's match with Lee Sedol, which was streamed live on all major online platforms with narration and commentary, came as a big blow to anyone who considers Go to be the ultimate barrier for artificial intelligence in climbing over that of the human.\nBefore the match started on March 9, Chinese forecasts fell neatly into two camps: Science majors overwhelmingly took the side of the machine while Go specialists believed in the ability of one of their best to come out ahead. Needless to say, the more you pinned your hope on Lee, the more disappointed you got.\nI'm not a science major and know nothing about Go. All the sci-fi movies I have seen have conditioned me to accept this as something of a given. Actually they go far beyond defeating humans at board games.\nFrom a layman's perspective, for anything that builds on the foundation of knowledge, humans do not have a chance vis-a-vis a computer, let alone a specially equipped and programmed one. The irony is, the more specific and in-depth the knowledge is, the easier it is for a machine to commit to memory and recall for use.\nGames have rules and possibilities, and a machine can outsmart a human because it can tap its storehouse instantly. Sure, Go involves strategizing, which is far more complicated than simply identifying the best out of a million possibilities. But anything that can be streamlined and quantified into a set of rules will leave humans at a disadvantage.\nAlphaGo's victory was a milestone in artificial intelligence research, but it's time to move beyond it. As Deep Blue's Murray Campbell said, it marked \"the end of an era ... board games are more or less done\".\nI have always believed that computers would be competent for highly convoluted tasks but would fail at childishly easy ones. Yes, it can memorize all the dictionaries in the world, but it wouldn't be able to translate very simple words and sentences.\nHave you ever used a translation program lately? They tout something like 85 percent accuracy rate, which, if you think of it, would mean mistakes in almost every sentence. The most unexpected outcome is, it can turn a solemn piece of writing into an unintentionally hilarious one.\nTake the English phrase \"come on\". There is no way a program can render it into Chinese with a satisfactory rate of correctness. English language natives may not be aware of it, but the phrase has very subtle changes in meaning, depending on the context, the tone of the speaker and other factors. In Chinese, every one of these possibilities requires a different phrase in translation.\nHave you seen Chinese movie subtitles that put \"Come on!\" for cheering for sports games? It's because one of the dictionary definitions equate it with \"Go! Go! Go!\" and a computer translator functions very much like a programmer in picking what he sees as the right option.\nThe beauty of a human language is its ambiguity. Great literature thrives on it. When Hamlet first opens his mouth and out comes, \"A little more than kin and less than kind\", its meaning can be sensed but not reproduced in another language. You can try, of course, and many have. The pun implies the speaker's intuitive suspicion.\n\"To be or not to be\" uses the simplest of English words, yet the Chinese version has to turn it into \"To live or to die\", which fails to recapture the elusive dichotomy of deep thinking and simple language.\nChinese, of course, is a rich language equally capable of such linguistic feats, if not more. I'll not quote the great literature of the past but trot out something funny my WeChat friends were posting today. It divides a man's life into four stages, with each one characterized by \"xihuan shang yige ren\". The six characters, making up four words, are exactly the same, and the trick is in the word shang and the difference in emphasis.\nIn the first one, it exists to smooth the tone and doesn't need to be translated. So, the phrase means \"to like a person\".\nIn stage two of a man's life, shang should be read as a verb, meaning \"mount\" or more specifically \"copulate with\".\nIn phase three, shang is an adjective that means \"the last\" or \"the one before\". A manifestation of midlife crisis for Chinese men is to regret that they did not get the woman who waltzed through their life without him realizing she is the one.\nFor the last stage, shang should be completely de-emphasized while \"a\" should be turned into \"one\". So, the sentence becomes \"like to be by himself or alone\".\nI don't think AI can distinguish between the four meanings on paper. Even if they're read out aloud, it could be hard because some of them sound exactly alike. Next time we test an AI program, don't go for the brainy stuff. Pick something like a tongue-twister or a pun or an advertising slogan. Or have it translate a poem, which I consider the ultimate trial.\nIt's wonderful that machines can do more, but machines are made by man and there are creative jobs that only man can perform. Often the deceptively simple ones. For all that I know, AI may not measure up to a pet when it comes to emotionally connecting with humans.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/63\/145852979036.png\nb083fe955fbe185987880d.png\n","167":"China set up its first artificial intelligence alliance on Wednesday in a move to expand the industry at a gallop.\u00a0\nLed by the China Center for Information Industry Development, tech giants like Intel China, iFlytek Co Ltd, JD.com, SAP China and Ecovacs Robotics Co teamed up to form the non-profit organization, called China Artificial Intelligence Industry Innovation Alliance, or CAIIIA for short.\nIt focuses on creating AI value through adjusting nimbly to technological acceleration that AI breakthroughs will bring about.\nThe newly formed alliance set goals to incubate 50 AI-enabled products and 40 firms, launch 20 pilot projects, and set up a general technology platform in the next three years.\nAt the launching ceremony, CAIIIA reached agreements with government officials to construct four industry bases in Tongzhou in Beijing, Songjiang in Shanghai, Qingshan in Wuhan, and Xixian New Area in Shaanxi province.\nThe launching ceremony kicked off at the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017, where industry leaders gathered to address opportunities and challenges with AI technologies.\n\"AI has arrived, incontrovertibly,\" said Yang Xueshan, former vice-minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the honorary advisor appointed by CAIIIA.\nAll human tasks, without exception, could be completed by AI technologies by 2050, said Yang, whose prediction is based on China's ever-increasing massive computing power and affordable tech resources in the long run.\nSo far, over 200 enterprises, including tech firms and research institutions, have joined the alliance.\n","168":"Events and stories coming up in the next few days\nOfficials to brief on innovation program\nThe State Council, China's Cabinet, will brief the media today on the government's mass entrepreneurship and innovation program, proposed by Premier Li Keqiang.

That changed when AlphaGo defeated the European Go champion Fan Hui last year in a 5-0 whitewash, in a closed-door match later published in the journal Nature. Since then, AlphaGo's performance has steadily improved.\nAlphaGo's successive wins over a human champion shows computers can mimic intuition and tackle more complex tasks, its creators say. They believe that ability could be used to help scientists solve tough real-world problems in health care and other areas.\n","175":"Baidu, the operator of China's largest search engine, said it has formed what it claims to be one of the world's largest and diversified open autonomous driving alliances with more than 50 partners as the company ramps up its efforts to accelerate the commercialisation of artificial intelligence.\n\u00a0\nThe Beijing-based firm said yesterday more than 50 companies, including 12 Chinese cars makers and two Western car firms - Ford and Daimler - as well as suppliers, component providers and ride sharing firms such as China's UCAR and Singapore-headquartered Grab Taxi, have jumped on board.\n\nIt is the first such partnership since Baidu launched its Project Apollo open autonomous driving platform in mid April.\n\nRather than produce self-driving cars, Baidu is banking on the open-source platform to \"export its technology capability and integrate resources\" for a \"win-win situation\" as artificial intelligence is set to reshape the car-making industry, said Lu Qi, chief operating officer of Nasdaq-listed Baidu.\n\nSpeaking at Baidu Create, the company's inaugural AI Developer Conference in Beijing attended by more than 4,000 participants, Lu said Baidu was well positioned to \"facilitate China to become the worldwide leader in autonomous driving in the coming three to five years\".\n\nHe also said Baidu would set up subsidiaries in the United States and Singapore to further fuel Apollo's development.\n\nBaidu is competing in autonomous driving with the likes of Google in the United States and Nissan in Japan, but the race is particularly important for the Chinese company as it seeks to transition into an AI-first company after its core search business was hit by Beijing's tighter controls over online medical advertisements.\n\nBaidu's position as a distant No 3 among China's top internet firms - known by the acronym BAT for Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent - has been at risk due to its shrinking revenue and market capitalisation, with e-commerce major JD.com catching up in market value.\n\nLu, an AI expert and former Microsoft executive who joined Baidu at the beginning of the year, said the company was already using AI to optimise its existing core businesses, such as web search and mobile Baidu apps.\n\n\"I see a lot of potential to use AI to grow our new businesses, such as autonomous driving and DuerOS (an AI-powered operating system), into core businesses,\" he said.\n\nAs well as companies such as Bosch, Continental Automotive, Nvidia and Microsoft Cloud, Baidu's Apollo alliance extends to five top Chinese universities and six local governments, including Wuhu city in Anhui province and Baoding city in Hebei province.\n\n\"AI is not factored into stock valuations yet, since it's still at an early stage. Strategy wise, we are supportive of this direction. I think both Apollo and DuerOS will be key drivers for Baidu in the future,\" said Ella Ji, a New York-based analyst with China Renaissance Securities US.\n\nCompared with DuerOS, Apollo is a longer term and more complicated project, she said.\n\n\"From cooperating with 50 partners, Apollo will get a lot of driving and traffic data, which is the key differentiation asset when competing in the AI era.\"\n\n\"However, global tech and auto companies are also working on autonomous driving. Baidu needs to compete on resources and execution. The margin for error is very small,\" Ji said.\n","176":"Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook Inc, told an audience at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday that he predicted more great advances for AI within the next decade.\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook Inc, talks with Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday.

As a big fan of Go, I never expected AI to be able to beat a human champion at the current stage of development since it's a pretty complicated game,\" he said. He predicted that \"fueled by this victory, capital and talent will flood into the AI sector\".\nDespite the breakthrough, e-commerce mogul Jack Ma, founder and chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, said there was no need for human beings to fear machines.\n\"Machines will be stronger and smarter than human beings, but they will never be wiser,\" he said, \"because one thing's for sure: Wisdom, soul and heart are things that only human beings possess, and machines can never enjoy failure, success, friendship or love.\"\nAt the forum, tech entrepreneurs also shared their views on virtual reality, which they said will be the most important computing platform over the next five to 10 years.\n\"There is a trend toward a more immersive and natural tool that can help us interact with the world every day. And I believe that is virtual reality,\" Zuckerberg said at the forum.\nHe highlighted Oculus VR, a VR company that Facebook acquired for $2 billion in 2014, saying that it will soon start to ship its latest products.\nIn February, Xiaomi set up a new division in a bid to branch into the nascent VR sector, which analysts forecast could rival the size of the smartphone industry in the future.\nAccording to a report by Goldman Sachs Group Inc, the VR market will generate $110 billion in hardware sales by 2025, if the technology is quickly adopted.\nBut for the next two to three years at least it will remain a niche interest, Lei said.\nWhat they say\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook Inc.

Here, it's not just a contest between governments, but among private companies whose business models and practices are expected to be profoundly affected. The technology is already having a big impact on our lives. That will only grow in coming years, and we better be prepared for the changes.\u00a0\nIt is no exaggeration to say that AI is likely to define the future of business. Companies and governments know this. As a result, there is now a big push for research and development in AI, and to lure top talent in both countries. The US is leading the field, not only by producing some of the most creative minds, but also investing the most in it. The mainland think tank Wuzhen Institute estimates that total investment in the US amounted to US$17.9 billion last year. It is followed by China, which injected US$2.6 billion into the sector.\nUnsurprisingly, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent Holdings - the Chinese internet triumvirate collectively known under the acronym BAT - are leading the way, just as their American counterparts - Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon (FAMGA) - are dominating the field overseas. Already, we are seeing its effects on automated call centres, driverless cars and self-ordering and checkouts at restaurants and supermarkets.\nWorld dominance in three steps: China sets out road map to lead in artificial intelligence by 2030\nChina has already surpassed the US as the world's largest automotive market, with the number of cars, buses and trucks increasing at a rate of 23.7 million additional units every year to an estimated 200 million vehicles by 2020. That volume of vehicles generates an amount of data that will dwarf other markets around the world. But beyond data collection, China would need to put in place new transport and legal infrastructure to enhance safety and the efficiency of driverless vehicles on the road.\nBut automated driving and road control is just one of many rapidly developing fields. Hospitals will be dispensing medicine through AI while doctors will use advanced programming to help with diagnosis. Financial trading and investment have already been using smart robots while some international news services have developed computer programmes to write simple news reports.\nThe possibilities are endless and will affect jobs in many fields. The Chinese government can clearly see the benefits of the technology, but must start dealing with possible adverse social consequences such as job losses. Education models need to change along with mindsets. Given the sheer size of its market and population as well as its ambition to become a leading technological nation, the impact of AI will perhaps be greater on China than most other countries.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Artificial intelligence has become the new growth point pushing China's development, so we hope to launch AI-enabled smartphones and products,\" said Kwon Gyehyun, president of Samsung Electronics China operations.\nKwon said the major competition in the smartphone industry now focuses on thickness, appearance and design of handsets, but not on technology, adding that there are bottlenecks and limits on the hardware sector, and that technical innovation is of great significance.\nSamsung's Bixby can respond to spoken commands, allowing users to control their phones with their voices alone. However, it is not an ordinary voice assist-ant, but rather an intuitive and comprehensive interface that leverages contextual awareness to learn users' habits and respond accordingly, according to Samsung.\nSamsung's Galaxy S8 series and Note 8 will be available for Bixby's Chinese version beginning next Thursday. The company will launch Bixby 2.0 version and strengthen the application of augmented reality in the Chinese market next year.\nSamsung has also cooperated with video-streaming site iQiyi.com, Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like app and bike-sharing company Mobike, enabling Bixby users to control these apps with their voices.\nBixby will go up against Apple Inc's Siri and Google Assistant. However, Samsung claims that it offers a \"deeper experience\" than other voice agents or assistants in the market.\nMoreover, Bixby will not be only used in smartphones, but also in tablets, televisions and refrigerators.\nOther smartphone manufacturers have ramped up efforts to apply AI in their smartphones.

NAN SHAN\/FOR CHINA DAILY\nEditor's Note: In this ongoing series on the birth and growth of privately owned Chinese companies that are redefining innovation, China Daily profiles Joyoung Co Ltd, one of China's leading private home appliance manufacturers and soybean milk makers, which plans to add to its research and development effort and develop more innovative new artificial intelligence home products.\nJoyoung, one of China's leading private home appliance manufacturers and soybean milk makers, said it plans to add to its research and development effort and develop more innovative new artificial intelligence home products to meet consumers' needs.\nCurrently, the soybean milk maker puts over 200 million yuan ($30 million) into research and development, equal to 3 percent of its sales revenues. It employs more than 700 people in its research and development team and aims to recruit more.\nThe Shenzhen-listed company has developed a variety of kitchen products, so soybean milk makers now make up less than 40 percent of its sales. Its products include cereal makers, juicers, electric furnaces, rice cookers, steamed bun cookers and noodle makers.\nJoyoung plans to continue to enrich its product list and has established a base in Zhejiang province. The region is the home of a range of accessories manufacturers that produce parts for Joyoung's different machines.\nWang Xuning, founder and CEO of Joyoung, said: \"We aim to solve troublesome problems in kitchens and make cooking easier. We plan to develop more new products and try to lead the sector by constant innovation.\"\n\"For instance, we launched robotic chef products about two months ago. They can cook up hundreds of different Chinese dishes. Consumers only need to put all the food materials in the pot, and the entire dish will be ready within 3 to 5 minutes. Now we have run out stock of that product,\" he said.\nOver two decades ago, Joyoung created the first machine to make soybean milk, a traditional healthy drink in China. Since then, the retailer has dominated the business in that industry, with over 100 million consumers using the brand's soybean milk machine.\nThe company said it would mainly focus on the domestic market, as its products mainly cater to Chinese consumers' cooking habits. Joyoung does export its soybean milk makers and noodle makers to Japan.\nDespite the fierce competition in the home appliance industry and a slowing economy, Joyoung achieved sales revenue of 7.06 billion yuan last year, jumping 18.9 percent over 2014, when the revenues were 5.94 billion yuan, 11.4 percent over 2013, according to the company.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/52\/147256385328.jpg\neca86bd9df04192f1e8433.jpg\n","186":"A top drone manufacturer and a police-backed facial \u00adrecognition firm are among dozens of companies set to \u00adreceive state subsidies as the mainland seeks to become a global powerhouse in internet technology, big data and artificial intelligence.\u00a0\n\nThe National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the nation's top economic planning agency, said 56 projects were in the first batch to receive the support in a key \u00adnational scheme.\n\nThey include \"e-governance\" systems developed by provincial authorities as well as drones and robots manufactured by private companies.\n\nThe NDRC launched the \u00adnational programme to promote what it described as \"internet plus, artificial intelligence and the digital economy\" with a call for submissions in October.\n\nThe 56 projects are the first to qualify for the state support and will gain subsidies if there is no objection in the next week.\n\nThe subsidies will also depend on each project's needs and size.\n\nSome of the country's biggest companies are in the runningfor the funding, including \u00ade-commerce giant JD.com, which is developing an open-source deep-learning platform, and \u00adtelecommunications company Huawei Technologies, which \u00adproposed a financial data \u00adapplication platform.\n\nThe NDRC said the artificial intelligence projects chosen \u00adfocused on mass production of smart chips, facial and voice \u00adrecognition systems, drones, and advanced intelligent service \u00adrobots.\n\nAmong the recipients are \u00adrobot projects at Shenzhen \u00adUBTECH Robotics and Shandong-based Synthesis Electronic Technology.\n\nFour developers of facial and voice recognition systems also got the nod, including Beijing \u00adZhongdun Security Technology Development, a company funded by the Ministry of Public Security; and CloudWalk Technology in Guangzhou.\n\nNDRC said some of the big data projects included a China-Russia big data office in Harbin, a digital trade platform between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and an e-commerce platform between China and the Middle East.\n","187":"The application of the technology is valuable, but more valuable is the idea of combining a blood-sugar-monitoring device with contact lenses.\nSouth Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol attends a press conference after finishing the final match of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match against Google's artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo. [Photo\/IC]\nGoogle has never been away from news. But this time it is hogging the limelight because its artificial intelligence-powered AlphaGo has defeated South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol 4:1 in a five-match series. AlphaGo's victory has also prompted some observers to say Google is far ahead of Chinese technology companies in terms of AI research. Such a conclusion, however, does not reflect reality.\u00a0\nIn terms of pure theoretical research in AI, China hardly lags behind the United States or any other country. Actually, it is hard to say which country is the leader because researchers across the world are cooperating rather than competing with each other. When a team achieves a technological breakthrough, it prefers to publish it in academic journals, which not just helps protect its intellectual rights but also allows researchers in other countries to share the vital information.\nIf we insist on comparing China and the US, there is hardly any gap between them because Chinese researchers have published almost as many papers as their US counterparts. At the 2015 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Beijing in July 2015, chairperson Yang Qiang, who is also head of the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology, said more papers were received and accepted from researchers in China than from any other country. That is the best footnote on AI researchers in China.\nHowever, there are gaps between China and the US in other fields of AI. China lags behind the US when it comes to putting its theoretical achievements to practical use. In image recognition, an essential sub-sector of AI research, for example, our AI at Baidu can judge whether a face belongs to a certain person more accurately than humans do in a laboratory environment. But the same AI can hardly recognize a person's face in a group of similar ones, which can be easily done by a human being. So Chinese researchers need to find ways to better combine theory with practical use.\nGoogle does this quite well. The driverless car it has been testing is a very good combination of image-recognition, scene-understanding and automatic-control technologies. By combining them well, Google has made a hitherto unthinkable product.\nCreative thinking is another sub-sector in which Chinese researchers lag relatively behind their counterparts in some advanced countries. In other words, some of the creative products can be made by any company, but the one that makes it first is the winner.\nGoogle's driverless car is one such example. The idea of a driverless car has been around since the 1980s, but Google took the lead in research in the current model. Chinese researchers have been doing so too but they are years behind Google, because they were not confident about the concept until Google announced its achievement.\nAnother example is Google Glass (contact lens), whose prototype emerged in April 2014 and which could monitor the blood sugar levels of the user.

Faced with a crisis, the government of the city in South China's Guangdong province began a campaign to replace workers with robots. Three years ago, the local municipality even set up a 200-million-yuan ($32 million) annual fund for enterprises employing robots. China Youth Daily comments:\u00a0\nTraditional manufacturing industries all over the world are feeling the pressure of the global economic downturn. But instead of shutting down their production units and spreading panic, enterprises can easily substitute human workers with robots. This may not revive abandoned plants in the short term but could establish a positive trend in the long run.\nAlan Turing proposed the \"artificial intelligence\" concept half a century ago. Today it is clear that Industry 4.0 (or the fourth industrial revolution) cannot be accomplished without the use of robots.\nSimilarly, the \"Made in China 2025\" concept is also inseparable from the core of \"artificial intelligence\". Global sales of industrial robots grew 26.4 percent in 2014, with the most rapid growth being in China.\nAfter \"machine substitution\", enterprises can substantially reduce their labor and management costs, and laid-off industrial workers will have to adapt to the changing trend and improve their skills in order to get greater value for their labor.\nFor many, the question still is: If robots take the place of workers, where will the workers go?\nAs enterprises go bankrupt or employ more robots, \"surplus\" labor will indeed encounter problems of employment and survival. But we still need artificial intelligence, albeit well-controlled, because it guarantees accuracy and efficiency, and workers will have to adjust to the changing situation.\n(China Daily 11\/27\/2015 page8)\n","192":"IQiyi, the mainland's equivalent of United States entertainment company Netflix, was casting around for a hit series last year when the idea for a hip-hop talent show emerged.\n\nThe executives at the\u00a0Baidu company were not sure at first.\n\u00a0\nRap is a niche genre in Chinese music and far from the mainstream, which has long been dominated by crooners and pop princesses such as Faye Wong and Jolin Tsai.

The smart system uses machine learning and AI to analyse the huge amount of search and video-viewing data on iQiyi's site to understand audience behaviour.\n\nThe company tied up with chip maker Nvidia to set up a \u00adresearch and development centre to work on a more personalised viewing experience for users.\n\nEven so, the machine is not \u00adinfallible. Tang said the Brain failed to forecast the hit drama \u00adseries In the Name of the People, which cast for the first time a relatively high-ranking Communist Party leader as a villain.\n\nAI also did not foresee the eventual backlash from the \u00adgovernment against hip-hop-themed shows.\n\nThe social media began to circulate a government order issued to broadcasters banning \"artists with tattoos, hip-hop music\" and other performers who are \"in conflict with the party's core values and morals\".

You are free to discuss anything with me and I'll help you explore the world's cultural heritage as best I can.\"\u00a0\nOn an apricot blossom April day at the 1,600-year-old Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, China's northwestern province of Gansu, a major ancient Silk Road hub, Lu Xiaoqiang was joyfully talking with the 24-hour online Chinese chatbot on his cellphone.\n\"How many caves are (there) in Mogao?\" asked Lu, who was traveling from China's southeast province of Fujian.\nWithin a second, XiaoIce replied, \"Of the 735 caves, 492 remain intact more or less.\"\nDunhuang XiaoIce, jointly developed by Microsoft and the Dunhuang Academy, made her debut in October last year, when AI saw drastic development in China. Within months, XiaoIce quickly became an online celebrity.\n\"Interesting! It's just like chatting with your close friends,\" Lu said. \"I was able to learn from her all sorts of things including the history and culture of the Mogao Caves and Dunhuang, and most importantly, in an easy and relaxing way.\"\nDunhuang XiaoIce knows the entire thousand-page \"Dunhuang Dictionary.\" In addition, she's able to absorb far more information through thousands of online conversations every day. The latest statistics show that the AI chatbot can reach around 2 million people every year, helping them better understand the mysterious Mogao Caves.\nDating back to 366AD, a Buddhist monk named Le Zun had a vision of a thousand Buddhas bathed in golden light at the Mount Mogao, which inspired him to build a cave there. That was when the Mogao Caves started and later gradually grew. Situated at a strategic point along the Silk Road, at the crossroads of trade as well as religious, cultural and intellectual influences, the 492 cells and cave sanctuaries in Mogao are famous for their statues and wall paintings, spanning 1,000 years of Buddhist art.\nAt that time, the monk Le must have never expected that his story and the essence of the ancient cave would be told by an artificial intelligence chatbot someday in the future.\nThe field of artificial intelligence research, born some 60 years ago, has experienced explosive growth in recent years thanks to the fast development of big data analytics and cloud computing and is highly expected to shape the world's Tomorrowland.\nToday, when AI meets ancient Dunhuang, it is expected to revolutionize communication, bringing new opportunities for the Belt and Road Initiative, unveiled three years ago.\n\"XiaoIce has offered a different way for people, to get information and learn about the Dunhuang culture. It was especially beloved by the younger generation,\" Wang Xudong, dean of the Dunhuang Academy, told Xinhua in an interview.\nWang said that the integration of AI technology and cultural studies also changed the way of preserving cultural relics and spreading Chinese culture.\nAs a matter of fact, Microsoft Research Asia is just one of the thousand high-tech companies, located at Zhongguancun, China's National Innovation Model Park, to participate into the Belt and Road Initiative.\nDr Hsiao-Wuen Hon, corporate vice president of Microsoft, chairman of Microsoft's Asia-Pacific R&D Group, and managing director of Microsoft Research Asia, told Xinhua that in the age of mobile Internet, AI can help people gain easy access to different cultures along the Belt and Road route in a fastest and most effective way, breaking down space and time barriers.\nIn addition to chatbots, digital technology, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), cloud-based instant translation and other frontier technologies are being closely combined with AI technology.\nAnother example is Microsoft Research Asia's work with the Dunhuang Academy to develop a Gigapixel Camera system that digitally captures high-resolution, large-format images of the Mogao Caves and resolves details not visible to the naked eye. The highly-detailed images captured by the Gigapixel Camera enables the Dunhuang scholars to preserve those valuable cultural artifacts for future generations.\n\"Digital technology gives life to cultural heritage, enabling an ancient culture to reach millions of households via the Internet,\" Wang said.\nAlso in April, a digital exhibition called \"Dunhuang on the Silk Road\" was held in Beijing, some 2,400 km away from Dunhuang. With the combination of VR, AR and other high-technology, visitors were able to receive an audio-visual feast of the Silk Road treasure.\n\"Culture and technology complement each other,\" Hon said. \"This allows them to stimulate more innovation.\n","198":"AlphaGo, the artificial intelligence programme developed by Google DeepMind, has defeated the world's No 1 player Ke Jie after securing a second straight victory yesterday in what had been billed as the ultimate battle of wits between man and machine.\u00a0\n\nThe match, which took much less time compared with the first game on Tuesday, suggests that AlphaGo has been improving its Go-playing skills ever since it stunned the world in 2016 by beating South Korean grand master Lee Sedol, the then reigning Go world champion, in a 4-1 match.\n\nThe 19-year-old Ke played well at the beginning and even successfully predicated several moves made by AlphaGo.\n\nBut as the match continued, AlphaGo turned the situation around by handling Ke's multi-angled assault and eventfully forcing him to resign.\n\n\"In the middle of the game, I thought I was very near to a win. But because I was too nervous, I later made some bad moves,\" Ke said in the post match press \u00adconference.\n\nAlphaGo dispatched Ke in 3.5 hours, an unexpectedly short period of time. The first game in competition lasted about 4.5 hours. A planned third match between Ke and AlphaGo is slated for Saturday, although the outcome won't affect the artificial intelligence's champion status.\n\nDeveloped by DeepMind, a London-based artificial intelligence firm acquired by Google in 2014, AlphaGo is the first AI-programme to outclass humans at Go, which is dubbed as the world's most complex board game because it requires players to make their move based on intuition rather than calculation.\n\n\"If you ask a chess player, why you make this move he or she will probably tell you a plan 'because A, B and C'. But if you ask a Go player the same question, the answer is usually 'because it feels right,'\" said Demis Hassabis, co-founder and chief executive of DeepMind.\n\nRather than programme its system, AlphaGo uses two different neural networks, or brains, one for selecting the next move to play and the other for valuing the move and predicting the winner of the game. This helps to ensure it can adapt to the gaming situation in real time.

It also uses a game strategy radically different from human players.\n\nAfter his first loss to AlphaGo, Ke described the artificial intelligence as \"a God-like Go player\" saying that many of its moves have never been seen in contests between humans.\n\nNie Weiping, a Go master , said it was unlikely that Ke would win on Saturday, noting that AlphaGo is \"clearly out of his league\".\n","199":"As an important part of Baidu's overall strategy, the company's educational platforms will evolve to be more content-rich, intelligent and personalized based on artificial-intelligence technologies, according to Zhang Yaqin, president of the Chinese tech giant.\u00a0\nThe internet and \"Intelligent Plus\" are bringing revolutions to traditional industries, Zhang noted in his speech at the 2016 Baidu Education Event held in Beijing on Monday.\n\"We believe artificial intelligence has the same influence for education industry. Technologies including cloud computing and big data are likely to play a major role in education in the future,\" said Zhang.\nInvited experts included Marielza Oliveira, director of UNESCO's office in China; Wang Shuguo, president of Xi'an Jiaotong University; and Clarissa Shen, vice president of Udacity -- a private online educational organization. It also gathered more than 800 educational professionals and organization representatives.\nIt is estimated that Baidu Library, an open educational platform under the Baidu search engine, receives more than 80 million visits daily. Meanwhile, about 400,000 people receive online education in the form of archives, electronic books and live-broadcast lessons every day using its online education platforms, according to Zhang Gao, general manager of Baidu's education division.\nA forum on issues including artificial intelligence's role in future education and the challenges and opportunities for nurturing talent in the new age was part of the event.\nAn education league that aims to integrate online and offline resources and focus on nurturing talent in the internet age was formed after the forum.\nBaidu's president Zhang also introduced the company's plan to launch a charitable education program aiming to help about 70 million left-behind children in China.\nThe program will take advantage of speech synthesis technology to enable the parents' voices to support the left-behind children's growth as much as possible.\nThe program will also use online education to help parents who are migrant workers learn agricultural and other skills so that they can finally make a living at home and be with their children, according to Zhang.\nRelated:\nWhere teachers are scarce, internet fills gap\nNobel laureate Smoot brings love of science to China\n","200":"\"China is a rising power in the field of AI work and research,\" says Fei-Fei Li, the chief scientist of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Google Cloud, while calling for enhanced AI cooperation between major powers.\nThe study of artificial intelligence, or AI, is at a tipping point, according to a computer scientist.\u00a0\n\"China is a rising power in the field of AI work and research,\" says Fei-Fei Li, the chief scientist of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Google Cloud, while calling for enhanced AI cooperation between major powers.\nLi made the remarks in a recent interview at Google's Beijing office.\nIn early December, Li said that Google would launch a new AI research center in Beijing, as part of its AI First strategy.\nWhen asked what prompted Google to open its center in the Chinese capital, Li says: \"We all recognize the importance of China because of its talent, and because of the incredible creativity and innovation that is already going on here.\"\nThe Google AI China Center, the first of its kind in Asia, will primarily focus on basic AI research.\n\"We've seen China paying a lot of attention to AI in terms of research, entrepreneurship, usage in industry as well as government support,\" says Li, noting that the Chinese government issued a plan for the development of \"the new generation of AI\" in July, and recently announced a three-year action plan.\n\"China is really a rising power, with more prominent global responsibility in technology, politics and culture,\" says the leading AI expert, adding that promoting cooperation between major countries will bring \"extraordinary benefits\" to humankind.\nShe acknowledged that AI is viewed by some as a new source of competition between countries. However, as a scientist, Li says she believes science has no national boundaries, and she hopes to see more cooperation and communication across borders.\nLi also notes there is a shortage worldwide of AI talent, whether in the United States or in China.\n\"I hope to mobilize more global talent to participate in AI research because it is such an important field of science and technology,\" she says.\nAsked about the potential for women in the sector, the female scientist says more work is needed. \"AI will change the world, but who will change AI? We want AI to be more inclusive and diverse.\"\nLi, who is also the director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, has made a successful transition from academia.\n\"I see the historical moment AI is experiencing: It has stepped out of the lab and has entered the stage of industrial applications,\" she says.\nLi is certainly at the heart of the historical moment.\n\"I hope to bring AI technology to most people and most industries,\" she says, adding that this will have a profound impact on daily life.\nLi says technology in this area has become relatively mature, especially facial recognition and object tracking technology, which have been used in smart shopping, driverless cars and medical imaging and pathological analysis.\nPotential application scenarios for AI are countless, says Li.\nAnd financial services, media and entertainment, business, medicine, energy, education, and manufacturing, are among the sectors deemed especially ripe for future growth.\n\"AI's use in the development of these industries has just started, but look at the massive demand,\" she says.\nAs for entirely new industries that might be spawned through AI, Li says: \"When John von Neumann came up with the idea of a computer, few people thought software engineering would become an industry. We need an adequate imagination.\"\nCommenting on the recent debate on whether AI will one day replace human intelligence, Li says the threat is overblown.\nShe cites a famous saying from the 1970s to clarify her view: The definition of today's AI is a computer that can make a perfect chess move while the room is on fire.\nThis means AI can accomplish plenty, such as memorizing 3,000 car models, but it doesn't understand the environment and context of every scenario, says Li.\n\"As a scientist, I want to keep the humbleness when I think about AI as a science as well as a technology,\" says Li. \"So it's important to recognize AI as a very young field. It still has a lot of open questions and challenges.\"\nHowever, AI can play an important role in many areas with more human-machine cooperation, says Li.\nReferring to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, she says robots would have been more practical as a replacement to humans undertaking dangerous disaster relief work.\nSmart machines can also assist human beings in repetitive labor, Li says.\nFor example, doctors can only diagnose a limited number of medical images, but machines can process a lot more at a likely lower cost and within a shorter time. This would allow doctors to conduct more valuable research and communicate more with patients, work that can't be done by AI.\n\"Machines don't have independent value,\" says Li. \"The value of machines is the value of human beings.\"\nXinhua\nThe pace of development in AI has been so rapid that smart machines can now perform tasks beyond the capabilities of humans.Photos provided to China Daily\n(China Daily 01\/10\/2018 page20)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/74\/151554639519.jpg\na41f726b05111bbf9fef1e.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/77\/151554640138.jpg\na41f726b05111bbf9ffb20.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/3\/151554640526.jpg\na41f726b05111bbf9ffe21.jpg\n","201":"Lenovo Group Ltd said it plans to pour $1.2 billion into the research and development of artificial intelligence, the internet of things and big data over the next four years.\u00a0\nAn exhibitor demonstrates Lenovo's prototype Think Mirror at an industry expo in Tokyo.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers think her future real-life incarnations can learn a thing or two from Steve Carell and other sitcom stars.\nMIT says a computer that binge-watched YouTube videos and TV shows such as The Office, Big Bang Theory and Desperate Housewives learned how to predict whether the actors were about to hug, kiss, shake hands or slap high fives - advances that eventually could help the next generation of artificial intelligence function less clumsily.\n\"It could help a robot move more fluidly through your living space,\" says lead researcher Carl Vondrick. \"The robot won't want to start pouring milk if it thinks you're about to pull the glass away.\"\u00a0\nVondrick also sees potential health-care applications: \"If you can predict that someone's about to fall down or start a fire or hurt themselves, it might give you a few seconds' advance notice to intervene.\"\nThe findings - two years in the making at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory - will be presented at International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in Las Vegas.\nVondrick, a doctoral candidate focusing on computer vision and machine learning with grants from Google and the National Science Foundation, worked with MIT professor Antonio Torralba and Hamed Pirsiavash, now at the University of Maryland. The trio wanted to see if they could create an algorithm that could mimic a human being's intuition in anticipating what will happen next after two people meet.\nTo refine what's known in artificial intelligence studies as \"predictive vision\", they needed to expose their machine-learning system to video showing humans greeting one another. Cue what Vondrick acknowledges were \"random videos off YouTube'.' Six hundred hours of them, to be precise.\nThe researchers downloaded the videos and converted them into visual representations - a sort of numerical interpretation of pixels on a screen that the algorithm could read and search for complex patterns.\nThey then showed the computer clips from TV sitcoms it had never seen before - interactions between Big Bang Theory stars Jim Parsons (Sheldon Cooper) and Kaley Cuoco (Penny), for example - and asked the algorithm to predict one second later whether the two would hug, kiss, shake hands or high-five.\nThe computer got it right more than 43 percent of the time. That may not sound like much, but it's better than existing algorithms with a 36 percent success rate. Humans make the right call 71 percent of the time.\nIn a video trailer of the study that showed the algorithm blowing it on a clip from The Office, the researchers quipped: \"So it's not perfect ... still a long way to go.\"\nThat likely will involve even more binge-watching. Six hundred hours of video sounds like a lot, but it's not really that much.

The country has also been leading in the number of AI research papers, with twice as many published than the US, but the quality of the papers lags the US when measured by citation impact, Elsevier's Scopus database shows.\nThe Chinese government has made AI a top priority, pledging to build a US$150 billion industry by 2030. The country has also recruited the country's biggest tech companies including Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent to join a so-called national team to jointly push the AI industry forward.\nThe increasing use of artificial intelligence is stoking privacy concerns in China\nHowever, ramped-up efforts by other countries in AI will heat up the competition with easier access to data and growing government investment in innovation and technology, analysts said.\n\"With high-growth start-up scenes in Israel and Japan and a recognised academic community in the UK, the true factor for success will lie in access to quality data and governments prioritising innovation,\" Jeff Wong, global chief innovation officer of EY, said in a statement.\n\"The countries that will ultimately break out of the pack will be those that focus on finding ways to unlock data and take full advantage of the access and forward-thinking insight it provides.\" he said.\nIn its fiscal 2018 budget Japan, a long-standing leader in robotics, is planning to spend 39.3 billion yen (US$370 billion) on the development of robotics and AI chips for next-generation computers, with an additional 19.6 billion yen for the adoption of AI in medical data management and pharmaceutical research. Official data show that the private sector in Japan invests around 600 billion yen in AI technology each year.\nThe AI scene in Israel, dubbed the \"start-up nation\" and ranked third in the world for innovation by the Global Competitive Index, is burgeoning as the country's AI start-ups raised US$1.1 billion in 2017, which accounts for 20 per cent of total investments raised by all Israeli start-ups last year.\nThese contenders are still playing catch-up but will soon narrow the gap, IDC's Chua said. \"For the rest of the countries, it will take some time but it won't take too long to catch up, because for the research that has been published, the other countries can also utilise, enhance and apply it and come up with enhanced models.

Also, those who receive a \"13th month\" payment at the end of the year or an annual bonus are likely to wait for this to be paid before looking to move on to another job, he said.\n\nThus, in Hong Kong and the mainland, there is a greater number of people leaving their jobs at the start of the year than at other periods, and so there is a greater number of vacancies needing to be filled early in the year. Should these bonuses disappoint, then that may prove an additional inducement to leave.\n\nBonuses at some leading investment banks were cut this year, with Deutsche Bank slashing its global bonus payment by 77 per cent, and UBS cut its global bonus pool by 17 per cent.\n\nForeign banks, especially European ones, are under pressure to cut costs in Asia.

But a US-based start-up believes that humans still need to be at the centre of it all.\u00a0\nSan Francisco-based Unanimous AI has developed artificial intelligence technology based on swarm intelligence - known as the collective behaviour often displayed when groups of people or animals amplify intelligence by working together as a group.\nThe company blends human decision-making processes with AI algorithms to determine the best solution in a question posed to a group of human participants, referred to as a swarm. The swarm is tasked with collectively finding the best answer to the question posed to them, while Unanimous AI's algorithms assess everything from the amount of time it takes for a participant to come to a decision and even the level of conviction they have in their choice.\n\"We have had great success in predicting and forecasting things like the results of sporting events, political events and even the Oscars,\" said David Baltaxe, chief intelligence officer at Unanimous AI, who added that its swarms have even outperformed traditional AI systems when it comes to forecasting and predictions.\nThe company had a 94 per cent success rate at this year's Academy Awards, accurately predicting the Oscar winners for all but one of the 16 major award categories, said Baltaxe, who was speaking on the sidelines of last week's Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference.\nUnanimous AI is one of many AI start-ups around the world eager to tap into the global artificial intelligence market, which is expected to reach US$21.46 billion in 2018. In recent years, scientists and researchers have achieved breakthroughs in the AI industry that have produced systems that have better reading comprehension than humans, the ability to drive a car without human intervention and even the skills to beat the world's top Go grandmaster.\nHowever, many of today's AI systems often exist externally from the people they are meant to serve. Unanimous AI is bucking the trend with its technology because believes that it is important to still keep humans in the decision-making loop.\n\"When groups of people get together, the output is much more accurate and satisfactory to all participants because everyone is participating,\" Baltaxe said.\nUnanimous AI's technology is often used by companies to tap on the collective intelligence of its consumer base on product optimisation and market trends, and can also be used internally by companies when they need to make decisions such as budgeting or even forecasting, Baltaxe said.\n\"Humans are social, hyperconnected creatures, and it is critical to us that the human judgment doesn't get lost ... the concerns are that the 'A' in artificial intelligence might become to stand for alien intelligence, where we won't be able to relate to it at all,\" he said.\n\"AI systems may be able to have great control over our lives, but [if the systems exist externally] we may not be able to comprehend why they come to certain decisions.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

To further verify the translation accuracy of its machine, Microsoft hired external bilingual human evaluators.\u00a0\nThe breakthrough in news translation comes amid the rise of artificial\u00a0intelligence-enabled bots in newsrooms across the globe as an increasing number of publishers experiment with different services to deliver news faster, expand coverage and help journalists focus on more value added tasks. While computers have beaten humans at complex strategy games such as Go and have started to develop skills like driving and even creating music, breaking language barriers and matching humans in translation is generally seen as a one of the most challenging tasks for machines to master.\nPing An Technology is leveraging AI music to boost stickiness of its financial products\n\"Hitting human parity in a machine translation task is a dream that all of us have had,\" said Xuedong Huang, a US-based technical fellow in charge of Microsoft's speech, natural language and machine translation efforts. \"We just didn't realise we'd be able to hit it so soon,\" he said in the blog post.\nAccording to a joint artificial intelligence impact research done by Oxford and Yale, based on a survey last year of 352 machine learning experts, AI wasn't seen outperforming humans in translation until 2024.\nTo reach the human parity milestone on the Chinese news article data set, three research teams in Microsoft's Beijing and Redmond, Washington, labs cooperated in using a number of training methods, including deep neural networks, to train its AI systems. This allowed the system to create translations more akin to what humans would naturally produce.\nOne of the earliest uses of a bot in journalism dates back to 2014 when a program called Quakebot broke the story of a 4.4 magnitude earthquake that hit Los Angeles at 6.25am on a Monday in March that year. By 6.33am The Los Angeles Times published the story online under the byline of Ken Schwencke, the developer of the quake-warning bot.\nIn China, where the central government has been ramping up efforts to build a US$150 billion artificial intelligence industry by 2030, the adoption of AI bots in journalism is also gaining momentum.\nArtificial\u00a0intelligence bot beats humans at reading in a first for machines\nIn 2015 Tencent Holdings, China's largest internet company by valuation, developed a bot it called Dreamwriter which could churn out an almost flawless 1,000-word, basic financial news story in Chinese - in 60 seconds.\nIn 2016 Toutiao, one of the country's most widely used news app run by Beijing Bytedance Technology, developed a Xiaomingbot, whose stories, mostly sports news, attracted as many clicks from readers as stories written by human reporters.\nAmong the more than 220,000 licensed reporters in China, including foreign correspondents, those who master bilingual skills are seen as the ones who are at least risk of being replaced by a bot due to the language barrier. Yang Yang, a features writer who works for one of the largest English language newspapers in China, said it would take years before robots could do her job despite their improving language skills.\n\"It is not just language skills. Being a good reporter, you need to experience, feel and even smell. Good [journalism] work is a combination of your memory and creation. It would be difficult for robots to achieve,\" said the Beijing-based Yang, who has been writing China stories in English for seven years.\nChen Changfeng, executive dean of the School of Journalism and Communication at China's Tsinghua University, said the advancement in AI translation requires students majoring in global communication to equip themselves with much better language skills and know-how that machines may never achieve.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

And that means if we want to create human-like artificial intelligence, we must make it emotionally responsive. But how do we know whether we have succeeded and the intelligence we have created is indeed able to experience real human-like emotions? That's where the metrics and tests developed by Alexei Samsonovich, a professor in the Cybernetics Department at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (MEPhI) National Research Nuclear University, could help us.\u00a0\nSamsonovich has come up with an artificial\u00a0intelligence test based on a relatively simple computer game. The program and a human both manipulate virtual people on a computer display, thus interacting with each other. The game involves actions with emotional content: a player may strike or push aside his co-player, or say \"hello\" and step aside to make way for him, or help him move off a stone or get out of a trap. As a result, the players engage in different types of social relationships, for instance, mutual trust, subordination and leadership.\nNormally, the Turing test is considered passed if a person is unable to guess whether his co-player is a machine or a human. In Samsonovich's case the idea is that the machine should have an emotional advantage over the average human player, which will manifest itself in players' wish to rescue the machine first.

[Photo\/Xinhua]\nSEOUL - Google's computer program AlphaGo on Thursday defeated South Korean Lee Sedol, the world champion of the ancient Chinese board game, taking a 2-0 lead in a historic match between a human and artificial intelligence (AI).\u00a0\nLee resigned about four and a half hours after the second match kicked off at 1 pm local time (0400 GMT) at Four Seasons hotel in Seoul.\nAfter exchanging 211 moves with AlphaGo, the 33-year-old accepted his second loss. During the first face-off on Wednesday, Lee resigned an hour earlier after trading 186 moves.\nIt was a shock to Go fans and experts as Lee, one of the greatest Go players who has won 18 world championships, was beaten for the second time in the historic five-game match that is seen as a representative match between humans and artificial intelligence.\nLee should win all of the three remaining games that will last until next Tuesday. The next match will be held at the same venue on Saturday.\nAlphaGo played in an incomprehensible and anomalous manner, which commentators said could be mistakes or algorithm errors at first sight, but it proved that those moves must have been intentional and pre-calculated ones from a broader perspective, which they said humans can never imagine.\nAlphaGo started off with anomalies. Playing Black, the computer program put its starter at the upper-right flower spot. In turn, Lee also placed his first white stone at a flower.\nAbout one and half minutes later, AlphaGo put the third marker at a position beside the flower spot, an unconventional move different from the previous day's strategy. AlphaGo placed its first two pieces on the flower spots on Wednesday.\nExchanging conventional moves with each other, AlphaGo put its 13th marker at an anomalous position in the middle of the upper board, which a commentator said was a move he had never seen in the human world of the game.\nLee \"calmly\" responded to AlphaGo's anomalous moves in an early phase, which one commentator regarded as perhaps mistakes, leading the game in his slight favor.\nAnother commentator said Lee seemed to have regained confidence as he returned to his regular style of playing after exchanging conventional moves with the computer program earlier in the game.\nHowever, Alphago took counterattacks at the middle areas of the white built up by Lee, rattling his emotional calmness. In exchange for part of the areas, the human Go champion won a smaller part of the black stones set by AlphaGo.\nLee seemed to have been slightly dominating by the middle of the match, but the mood was abruptly overturned as AlphaGo's mistakes began to be regarded as intentional moves from a broader perspective.\nAt the first sight, AlphaGo made two fatal mistakes, which commentators described as algorithm errors and incomprehensible. The result was unpredictable until near the end due to the incomprehensible moves, which commentators said humans cannot imagine.\nIt proved that AlphaGo's choices, which seemed to have been mistakes at the first sight, were right and calculated ones based on its predicted final result.\nAlphaGo's moves may look like mistakes from humans' perspectives and according to ways that professional human players learned how to play Go, but the result showed AlphaGo's broader perspective only aimed at winning an entire game despite losses in some parts of the board, experts noted.\n","220":"Over the past week, the Internet has yet again been buzzing about the future of artificial intelligence.\nBEIJING - Over the past week, the Internet has yet again been buzzing about the future of artificial intelligence (AI).\nAnd once again, the heat was generated by AlphaGo, Google's AI program, which completed a 3-0 clean sweep Friday over Ke Jie, the current world No 1 Go player.\nIn contrast to the generally negative reactions to AlphaGo's 4-1 victory over South Korean master Lee Se-dol in March last year, people are now more optimistic towards the future of AI.\u00a0\n\"AlphaGo was not designed just to play Go,\" said Qian Jianlun, a Go teacher in east China's Zhejiang province. \"As an AI project, it will change a lot of aspects of our lives.\"\nFull speed ahead\nQian's words echoed the overall positivity shown by the status quo of China's AI industry.\nAccording to data from iiMedia Research, a major research institution, China's AI industry increased by 43.3 percent in 2016, surpassing 10 billion yuan ($1.47 billion), and is expected to reach 15.21 billion and 34.43 billion yuan in 2017 and 2019 respectively.\nThe numbers were driven by a boom in the amount of research taking place in the industry.

It also makes me recall how I first fell in love with it.\nWeiqi players at a contest held in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning province. [Photo provided to China Daily]\u00a0\nThe recent win of Google Inc's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo over South Korea's Lee Sel-do, one of the world's best Go players, has reignited my enthusiasm over the ancient Chinese board game. It also makes me recall how I first fell in love with it.\nIt was in 1985, when Chinese Go grandmaster Nie Weiping defeated Japanese elite players one by one for the first time in a tournament. It was shortly after China started to open up to the outside world and was craving for anything that would help lift national morale. China Central Television broadcast his games live, and Nie became a household name overnight. You were out if you knew nothing about Go, or weiqi in Chinese, at that time.\nSo I started to learn to play, by reading books and watching lessons on TV, which was not very hard, and tried to seize every chance to hone my newly acquired skill. Yet finding someone at a comparable level and who was willing to play with me, in a certain place at a certain time, proved far more difficult. The process, which cost me a lot of time and gave me many headaches, finally sapped me of any impulse to play.\nThe situation has changed with the onset of the internet age since the 1990s, which saw the emergence of hundreds of online Go-playing platforms that link up players worldwide. Amateur players suddenly found themselves pampered with all convenience available in cyberspace. Finding someone to play with takes just seconds. I registered with one platform and spent some of my finest hours playing with other Go fans for free.\nThere were nuisances, such as when you encountered players who would not accept defeat, yet could do nothing about it due to the technical limitations of the system. But the biggest problem was that such platforms had no profit-making mechanism to sustain their growth, forcing many to close down not long after. One day I found the site I had registered with was inaccessible, and was heartbroken to see my hard achieved skill-level rating gone together with my game records. I had no interest in playing online any more.\nBut the enthusiasm for Go never dies out. The fever sparked by AlphaGo's spectacular performance against the human brain was contagious and I soon found myself lured back to a Go-playing website last month.\nIt is not a big one, with peak time online active players estimated at several thousands. Yet it is run in a way that seems to promise a bright future. For example, it charges a meager amount fee, 20 yuan ($3.07) a month, for premium services such as situation assessment, which makes you aware of how much you are getting an upper hand over, or lagging behind your opponent, thus boosting your chance of winning. I happily paid 50 yuan through WeChat for a three-month membership at a discount. So far the experience has been pleasant enough for me to consider renewing my membership. Technical advances in the system have made the games smooth. Now it has become a routine for me to play a game each day after work.\nThe spring of Go has come, especially in the monetary sense. The number of China's Go fans is estimated at 30 million. Experts believe the Go market size could be up to 30 billion yuan if both online and offline resources are tapped, such as Go schools and Go apps on smartphones.\nSome early birds have already jumped on the bandwagon. Online Go education platform Aiqidao completed its first round of fundraising early this year, which values it at 40 million yuan. Song Junbo, one of the angel investors, told the media there are millions of children in smaller cities who want to learn Go but have no resources like those in large cities. Aiqidao can serve as a bridge between Go masters and learners.\n\"The market is huge enough,\" he said.\nContact the writer at huangxiangyang@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 04\/14\/2016 page14)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/28\/146060568879.jpg\na41f72773d1b1879497721.jpg\n","233":"Banking disintermediation - essentially, taking out the middle man - has taken on a new twist.

Only in this way can China's high-end manufacturing avoid excessive dependence on foreign technologies.\nIntelligent manufacturing will also provide China with advanced equipment, such as robots, to replace workers in labor-intensive industries and enterprises that are increasingly plagued by labor shortages.\nIn fact, due to the rising costs of raw materials, fluctuating market demand as well as lingering operational pressures, some domestic manufacturing and services enterprises have already turned to robots or other intelligent equipment in recent years.

Despite the enormous demand, China's robot market is now overwhelmingly dominated by foreign brands. The high prices of imported key parts mean robots sold at home are expensive, which has hindered their popularization among domestic enterprises, especially small and medium-sized ones.\nTo address this issue, the country should make greater efforts to develop its own intelligent manufacturing and implement its ambitious development strategy mapped out for domestic manufacturing by 2025.\nThe above is an abridgement of a People's Daily article published on Thursday.\n","242":"The term \"artificial intelligence\" is often associated with driverless cars and highly sophisticated machines that can outsmart even the best of human minds in complicated tasks, such as the strategy board game Go.\nInternet, cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence will transform lives\nThe term \"artificial intelligence\" is often associated with driverless cars and highly sophisticated machines that can outsmart even the best of human minds in complicated tasks, such as the strategy board game Go.\nBut the Chinese experience suggests that technologies as such are innovated not just for these attention-grabbing examples, but to make substantial improvements in day-to-day life.\nIn his address to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping called for more efforts to foster new areas of growth through further integration of the internet, big data and artificial intelligence with the real economy.\u00a0\nChina will advance supply-side structural reform next year, with more efforts to improve the quality of economic growth, promote innovation and foster new growth drivers, according to a statement released after the annual Central Economic Work Conference last week.\nIn the country's campaign for high-quality development, the innovation-oriented digital economy and new technologies are certain to play a key role.\nThe digital economy - which features the use of the internet, cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence into a variety of sectors - will contribute to 70 percent of newly added economic output this year.\n\"The digital economy will be key to helping China become a leading industrial power and enter the 'fourth industrial revolution',\" said Tencent Chairman Pony Ma.\nOn the retail front, AI is playing a less visible albeit vital role in changing online shopping experiences by using algorithms to track, analyze and satisfy the specific needs of each and every consumer.\nOnline shoppers these days can often find similar alternatives appearing on their screens after searching for a particular product. Virtual shop fronts could also display different products, based on each customer's buying habits and preferences.\n\"All of this is made possible with the application of AI,\" said Wang Xin, a partner covering the technology industry at global consultancy Roland Berger. \"The computer learns to recognize patterns in the data and builds up a base of experiences that can be applied to solve problems in new situations.\"\nBeyond generating big numbers in online transaction volume, Chinese e-commerce players are also striving to reshape the manufacturing process based on personalized needs and revamping physical retailing using novel technologies.\nBy acquiring stakes in brick-and-mortar malls, data-rich companies such as Alibaba, JD and Tencent help retailers merge online and offline resources with the aid of AI, big data and cloud computing technologies.\nThousands of labels are being converted into \"intelligent retail outlets\". Through an interconnected system, they allow shoppers to track product availability at other locations in real time and get timely delivery while choosing to pay with their smartphone.\nBecause technologies track your preferences and streamline production processes, customers stand to enjoy perks from smart lipstick recommendations to ordering tailor-made outfits.\n\"Since the introduction of these high-tech gadgets, we've seen customer traffic flow grow 20 percent in the November promotion season from the annual average,\" said Chen Xiaodong, CEO of InTime Retail, a leading shopping mall chain.\n\"The whole new retail development is helping to improve efficiencies in the retail infrastructure and greater engagement with consumers, especially reaching into the rural market,\" said Matthew Crabbe, Asia-Pacific research director of consultancy Mintel.\nA case in point is that hundreds of thousands of \"mom-and-pop\" convenience stores across the country's counties and villages have undergone a digital makeover: they include data analytics from stocking shelves to running the register in a bid to precisely predict sales and manage inventory.\nOn the payment front, mobile wallets, initially designed to facilitate online transactions, have now penetrated public services and wealth management, streamlining administration and enhancing efficiency.\nThe Chinese people are also conferring internet business models and know-hows to foreign players. From Southeast Asia to North America, consumers celebrate online shopping sprees, swipe virtual credit cards and ride shared bikes backed by mobile payment technologies.\nBut more importantly, financial technology should be given full play to energize the real economy, especially in promoting inclusive finance through cost reduction and revamping of traditional models of the financial services, said Liu Guoqiang, assistant governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.\nSearch engine Baidu Inc has stepped into the online finance arena by offering loans to credible businesses who advertise on its site, and adopting artificial intelligence into client sorting and assessment, said Zhu Guang, the company's senior vice-president.\n\"We've lent 5 million yuan ($760,850) to help a hairy crab farmer extend retail networks in Beijing and Shanghai, and he said he earned an extra margin of over 100 million yuan, thanks to the timely financial injection (from us),\" he said.\nJD's online finance arm JD Finance offers peasants a tailored and periodic release of loans to avoid idle cash, based on a quantitative model that tracks the entire process of agricultural production.\n\"No collaterals is needed, as data analytics would step in to monitor credit history, word-of-mouth appraisal and real-time business operations,\" said Chen Shengqiang, CEO of JD Finance. He said the firm also utilizes internet of things technologies to predict and prevent epidemic situations of livestock and offer distant diagnosis, he noted.\nApart from subtle enhancements in life, new technologies and services have taken on more enterprising undertakings.\nChina unveiled a three-year plan in December to boost the application of AI in the automobile, robotics, healthcare and other sectors, in its latest push to upgrade the country's real economy.\nThe plan, published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said China, aims to build a globally competitive smart internet-connected car industry by 2020, with breakthroughs in self-driving platforms.\nAI-enabled service robots will also be widely used in China within three years, with focus on robots that can help seniors and children. Also, the country aims to accelerate the use of AI-enabled systems to assist doctors in medical cases.\nChina's manufacturing sector has also embraced cloud computing and AI, giving initiatives such as \"Made in China 2025\" real meaning. Major cloud operators including Tencent Cloud are building industrial big data platforms for Chinese manufacturers that can connect their facilities globally.\nUsing predictive analysis, such platforms can detect, avert or tackle glitches in real time, improving efficiency.\nAn indigenous navigation satellite system is crucial to such development. China's BeiDou now covers the entire Asia-Pacific region, enabling wider applications in logistics, aviation, precision farming and other industries that demand high-accuracy positioning.\nBeiDou accounted for about 70 percent of the nation's market share of chips, equipment, software, algorithms and other services directly related to satellite navigation in 2016.\nChina plans to expand the BeiDou network to cover countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative by the end of 2018.\nContact the writers at hewei@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 12\/27\/2017 page14)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/90\/151433569021.jpg\na41f726b05111bad28a10c.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/92\/151433569160.jpg\na41f726b05111bad28ac0d.jpg\n","243":"Seven Seas Partners, a venture capital firm founded by Tencent Holdings' former chief technology officer, has led a 350 million yuan (US$53.6 million) funding round in a Chinese start-up, betting big to find the next Chinese tech giant in the robot sector.\u00a0\nThe funding for Roobo, a Beijing start-up that sells conversational service robots, would lift the firm's valuation close to that of a unicorn - private companies valuated at US$1 billion or more, according to the company's chief executive Liu Yingbo.\nApart from the capital injection announced on Wednesday, Jeff Xiong Minghua, who was Tencent's CTO for eight years until his departure from the social networking giant in 2013, will also serve as the chairman of the board of Roobo.\n\"I really hope that I can find and cultivate the next Tencent in China.

Other AI applications could take over process-driven jobs.\nThe Philippines' industry of business process outsourcing, or BPO, is an economic lifeline for the Southeast Asian nation of 100 million people. It employs about 1.15 million people and, along with remittances from overseas workers, remains one of the top two earners of foreign exchange.\n\"I don't think our excellent command of spoken English is going to really be a protection five, 10 years from now.

Putting Hal in charge of the flight, you are able to literally be asleep at the wheel.\nSuddenly the robot reports that an antenna control device has malfunctioned, but you find nothing is wrong and a comprehensive check indicates that Hal has made an error. Hal, however, insists that the problem exists and believes it is due to human error.\nA conflict between man and an AI robot ensues.\nYou decide to disconnect him in case of any emergency. Hal, however, is determined to make a preemptive strike.\nThis is the scenario of the legendary science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey. But with the swift development of technology, an AI robot like Hal that can rival or even outcompete human beings is maybe closer to reality than you think, and it is something that Stephen Hawking is worried about.\nThe renowned scientist reiterated his warning about the risks posed by AI at a technology conference in Beijing on Thursday. And his views were echoed by other participants.\n\"The development of full AI could spell the end of the human race,\" said Hawking, who is credited with pushing the boundaries of technology and science in pioneering ways.\n\"AI would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded,\" he said in a rare video speech to a Chinese audience.\nAccording to Hawking, there is no real difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain, and what can be achieved by a computer.

Also, more research is needed to decide how a self-driving car may, in an emergency, have to decide between the minor risk of a major accident, and the major probability of a minor accident, experts said.\nPrivacy concern also abounds given that cutting-edge AI is becoming increasingly capable of interpreting large surveillance datasets.\nLee said tech heavyweights boast endless data, which enables them to swap user privacy for profits. It is quite hard for them to resist such attempts. Once big tech companies can't restrain themselves, it will also stifle innovation from startups.\nHawking said that although the companies are currently using the data only for statistical purposes, the use of any personal information should be banned.\n\"It would help protect privacy, if all material on the internet were encrypted by quantum cryptography with a code that the internet companies could not break in a reasonable time. But the security services would object to this,\" he said.\nIn long term, the ultimate concern is the potential loss of control of AI systems. That is, the rise of super-intelligences that does not act in accordance with human wishes, Hawking added.\n\"Success in creating AI could be the biggest event in the history of civilization.

He said that security intelligence has to be smarter than simply collecting data and conducting analysis.\nHe said while enterprises now learn to leverage data and optimise decision-making through data analysis, in the sphere of cyber security, mere data analysis is still too slow and passive when it comes to reacting to attacks.\n\"You can collect all possible information about the world. You can do it continuously,\" he said, \"[You can] collect them, do an analysis and then you will come up with the best security strategy and practise. But by the time you come up with that best strategy, you well might be dead, under attack or your money will be stolen.\"\n\"Security intelligence is not about data-collection and analytics,\" he said. \"Yes you have to use them. But the most important thing about security intelligence is not dealing with data because data is passive and data is impotent.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

[Photo by Li Zhong\/For China Daily]\nIntelligent software helps customize product recommendations and sales\u00a0\nChinese e-retailers are using artificial intelligence or AI to enhance and redefine the entire shopping experience for the consumer.\nIn doing so, they are dispelling the notion that the newage technology is all about driverless cars, futuristic robots and supercomputers such as the Go (that beat human players in a complex board game).\nFor instance, Tencent Holdings Ltd, known for its killer app WeChat and video game apps, is deploying AI to recommend products and services to users of its mobile wallet WeChat Pay.\nSuch users win virtual red packets containing real cash for offline purchases, which can be redeemed later in online shopping at partner sites.\nAccording to Ren Yuxin, Tencent's chief operating officer, the company is also empowering partner merchants to personalize their virtual storefronts for individual visitors. The idea is to offer real-time, tailor-made product recommendations based on a variety of factors like age, gender, location and purchasing power.\nTencent has also teamed up with China's second-largest online site JD.com, offering merchants customized content marketing opportunities via WeChat's Moments, an information-sharing function, banking on algorithms that analyze a person's interests, location and purchasing power.\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd, the world's largest e-commerce site by transaction volume, has embedded AI into its digital infrastructure, aiming to provide more precise search results and relevant product recommendations to users, and thus drive sales.\nThe tech giant has developed a so-called \"E-commerce Brain\" to understand people's needs and deliver relevant holistic recommendations.\nBy adopting real-time online data to build models to predict what consumers want, the system generates recommendations for not only products they have shown an interest in but related products and other information.\n\"Alibaba's Brain can home in on a consumer's predilections for certain products, price ranges, brands, product specifications and other key parameters,\" said Zhao Binqiang, an algorithm expert at Alibaba who now leads the firm's digital marketing unit.\nThe software works in tandem with Alibaba's vast social media networks. Algorithms allow the system to determine correlations between content consumption and purchasing behavior.\nFor example, if a mother has purchased diapers via Alibaba's Taobao site, she is likely to receive maternity and child-care related content from Weitao, a micro-blogging service for brands, or from Taobao Headlines, a sister newsfeed. Via such online destinations, she might receive sponsored content on products such as infant formula or supplements.\nAlibaba also introduced an AI-powered electronic assistant or chatbot called Ali Xiaomi (Ali Assistant) to handle up to 95 percent of general inquiries ranging from refunds to complaints.\nAccording to Alibaba, the chatbot, when provided with a text or voice description or even a photo, can even help users find products, returning a list of recommendations that they could filter by brand, color and other characteristics.\nA Goldman Sachs report earlier this year said, \"Big data, cloud services and the coming of age of machine learning technology should continue to deliver a personalized shopping experience to consumers and targeted marketing solutions to brands and merchants.\"\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/15\/151234844500.jpg\na41f726b08411b8ecc6807.jpg\n","254":"A hospital in Northeast China is using robots and artificial intelligence to help treat children with autism.\nA child with autism interacts with robots at Harbin Children's Hospital, as part of an innovative approach to treatment. [Zhou Huiying\/China Daily]\u00a0\nA hospital in Northeast China is using robots and artificial intelligence to help treat children with autism.\nSince its opening in mid-September, the E-Medical Artificial Intelligent Cognitive Rehabilitation Center at Harbin Children's Hospital in Heilongjiang province has received about 30 children with autism who will undergo advanced treatment assistance through one of its 10 robots.\nEach robot\uff0dall take the name RoBoHoN\uff0dis about 33 centimeters tall and looks like a friendly cartoon character. With a childlike voice, it can sing, talk and carry on a simple conversation as it engages young patients. Doctors at the center believe the robots will perform an important role in encouraging the children to speak. Results will be evaluated in three to six months.\n\"My son repeats himself and has great difficulty communicating with others,\" a mother surnamed Zhang said of her autistic 6-year-old son, who began a training program at the hospital a year ago.\n\"I found he liked the robot very much, although he didn't talk with it,\" she said. \"I hope he'll experience some positive changes with the help of robots.\"\nThe center is said to be the first in the country to use robots to help treat children with autism.\nAutism is a neural disorder that causes difficulties in social interaction and communication. Sufferers usually have restricted, repetitive behavior patterns.\nThe genetic disorder affects about 1 percent of the world's population. In China, more than 10 million people have autism. Of those, more than 2 million are under age 14, according to a report on the development of autism rehabilitation techniques.\n\"We are in urgent need of ways to treat autism,\" Yang Guangxue, director of the Autism Research Center at East China Normal University, said during a forum on autism at the hospital.\n\"It is estimated that the number of children with autism will continue to increase in the next few years.\"\nLi Huaining, deputy director of the hospital, said the number of afflicted children has been increasing. \"Now, every month, we receive about 70 children for treatment and rehabilitation.\"\nTo meet the increasing demand, the RoBoHoN robots were developed by Harbin Children's Hospital and Harbin E-Medical Technology Co to assist doctors and parents.\nThey fulfill important tasks at home, such as tracking a child's health, providing reminders to take medicines, providing comfort for lonely children and sending medical data to doctors.\nFurther, parents have access to long-distance medical consultations through the robot. Taking a robot home costs about 20 yuan ($3) per day.\nAccording to the company, the technology used in the robots will be widely applied in sectors such as online medical treatment in the future.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/13\/150664713104.jpg\nb083fe96fac21b37d5dd43.jpg\n","255":"China aims to build a 1 trillion yuan ($147.9 billion) artificial intelligence industry by 2030.\nA school girl gazes at a robot on display at an expo in Zhengzhou, Henan province, May 27, 2017.

It highlights China's determination to achieve breakthroughs in core AI technologies and accelerate its application in the manufacturing, service, agriculture and other sectors.\nTo achieve the goal, the AI industry in China is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan in 2020, putting the country on par with leading powers in the technology and its application. The current market size for China's AI industry was not disclosed.\nThe plan said more effort will be made to achieve breakthroughs in fundamental research and technologies. By 2025, China aims to more than double the 2020 target of its AI industry to 400 billion yuan. AI will be a major driver of industrial upgrading, widely used in manufacturing, smart city plans, agriculture, defense and other sectors.\nXiang Yang, an AI expert at the China Center for Information Industry Development, said the ambitious plan will motivate companies and universities to step up their research and development in AI.\n\"It will have roughly the same impact on industry as the government's Made in China 2025 initiative has had on the manufacturing sector,\" Xiang said.\nConsultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts that AI-related industries will boost China's GDP by as much as 26 percent in 2030.\nZhang Yaqin, president of Baidu, said China is highly likely to outpace the United States in the application of AI, as local companies scramble to experiment with new ideas and benefit from the country's huge user base.\nThe company plans to mass-produce its driverless vehicles within four years.\nGao Qiqi, a professor at East China University of Political Science and Law, said China is making rapid progress in AI and produces more science and technology papers and applies for more patents than other countries.\nAnand Rao, an AI consultant at PwC, said initially North America would have faster productivity gains from AI than China because of its mature infrastructure. \"But China will begin to pull ahead of the US in AI in 10 years after it catches up on both relevant technologies and expertise,\" Rao said.\n","256":"Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo, which is capable of playing the board game Go against human players, has been making waves since it became the first computer program to beat a professional human Go player without handicaps in 2015.\nA visitor interacts with an AI robot at a high-tech event on Nov 23, 2016, in Beijing. Zou Hong \/ China Daily\u00a0\nNew technology could help China to gain and maintain an edge over foreign competitors\nGoogle's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo, which is capable of playing the board game Go against human players, has been making waves since it became the first computer program to beat a professional human Go player without handicaps in 2015.\nAs of Jan 5, AlphaGo had an online record of 60 consecutive wins, and as it continues to grab headlines, intellectual property protection concerning AI technologies has also become a hot topic among industry insiders.\nInternet-related technologies promote innovation and growth in the sector, Sun Zhenan, deputy chief engineer with the Institute of Automation at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said at a forum on AI and its intellectual property in mid-December last year.\n\"In particular, the emergence of deep learning and big data has led to explosive growth in the AI sector,\" Sun said.\nPatent filings in the sector have maintained a steady growth momentum over the past two decades, with the United States taking the top spot, followed by China and Japan, according to reports in the Chinese media.\nThe three countries contributed 73.85 percent to the total patents concerning AI technologies worldwide, according to a report on global AI development, which was released during the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, last November.\nWith its technological edge in research into voice, text, image and facial recognition, China is well placed to compete globally when it comes to AI, Sun said.\nThe accurate voice recognition system developed by Baidu, China's leading search engine service provider, is a prime example. The technology, which can recognize both English and Chinese speech, was ranked among the 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2016 by the MIT Technology Review.\nWang Haifeng, vice-president of Baidu, told Chinese media that the future of any technology depends on its ability to make a user's life easier. \"The simplicity and user-friendliness of any piece of technology makes it accessible to both children and the elderly, and this is where voice technology stands out.\"\nIn comparison, the US takes the lead globally in developing brain-inspired cognitive systems and computing models, neuromorphic chips and quantum computers, experts said.\nDifferent from the US, which places greater emphasis on fundamental research, AI technologies from China focus more on commercial use.\nIndustry insiders have called on Chinese companies to focus more on the cutting edge of AI research and development.\nAn appropriate patent strategy is crucial to protect AI research, said an official at the State Intellectual Property Office, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nMany AI technologies involve interdisciplinary research and, as a result, their patent filings tend to be complicated, the official said.\nMa Xiaoya, a partner at a Beijing-based IP agency firm, said patent filings in the AI sector generally cover the collection and processing of mass data, model training, deep learning, algorithm optimization and functional modules. These are easily classifiable as non-patented intelligence activities.\nThus, patent filers need to pay attention to the required documentation for specific technological resolutions, she noted.\nThe choice of the location and timing for patent filings has a close proximity with the patented technologies' industrialization and commercialization.\nThe Wuzhen Report found that the US, China and the United Kingdom contributed 65.73 percent of the world's AI businesses.\nIn China, the businesses cluster into such metropolises as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, which accounted for 7.4 percent of the world's total.\nThe boom is being fueled by the increasing number of mergers and acquisitions that are sweeping the globe, as well as an influx of capital to the sector.\nJapan's SoftBank Group spent more than $32 million in taking over chip designer ARM Holdings in the UK in July.

[Photo by\/Shizuo Kambayashi\/Associated Press]\nSince Alan Turing proposed the concept of artificial intelligence in the 1950s, human beings have exerted great efforts to create machines that can think and communicate like humans.\u00a0\nTo see if a computer can think like a human, he fashioned a test, later called the Turing Test, in which a computer is submitted to a five-minute blind assessment given by human questioners. A computer is deemed to have passed the test if more than 30 percent of its answers are mistaken for having been given by a human being.\nIn June 2014, media reports claimed that \"the 65 year-old iconic Turing Test was passed for the very first time by supercomputer Eugene Goostman during Turing Test 2014 held at the renowned Royal Society in London\".\nEugene Goostman, simulating a 13-year-old boy from Ukraine, achieved 33 percent.\nHowever, some researchers questioned the success by pointing out that by making the computer a 13-year-old boy from Ukraine gave it an advantage, as when it provided some odd answers in English. Others identified the supercomputer as only a chatbot without artificial intelligence, and said many other chatbots - including Cleverbot that achieved 59 percent in 2011 - had also claimed to have passed the test. But they are not AI.\nOne of the most exciting achievements in the development of AI technology in recent years is the breakthrough made by Google's DeepMind team in London.\nThe team's Deep Q-Network algorithms can learn to play new computer games like Breakout or Spaceship Invaders. Gradually, the algorithms will play better and better by accumulating experience in previous rounds, and in some cases, they can even develop new strategies.\n\"Whether robots can overtake human beings depends on the learning ability of robots,\" says Qu Daoqui, chief executive officer of Siasun Robots & Automations in Shenyang.\nChristopher G Atkeson, professor in the Robotics Institute and Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University, is one of the scientists who help to create the lovely inflatable caregiver robot Baymax in the animation film, Big Hero 6.\n\"I believe this achievement is the best of its kind at learning to play video games. I believe these learning techniques are also doing well in speech recognition and vision,\" he says in an e-mail response to China Daily, referring to Google's efforts.\n\"This is a step forward, but not a complete solution to AI,\" he qualifies. One of the bottlenecks for AI is \"we do not yet have a general theory of how thinking works. We can (only) develop algorithms for specific tasks.\"\nMichael A Osborne, associate professor in machine learning at the University of Oxford, shares a similar view.\n\"The DeepMind team has made amazing advances at the frontiers of deep learning and reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, I think all at DeepMind would recognize the substantial challenges that remain in developing full AI.\n\"We're still far from being able to reproduce in software the deep understanding of our environments, like societal norms and cultural cues, that comes naturally to us given only limited examples,\" he says.\nJust as Google positions itself as an AI company, China's search engine giant Baidu is also investing heavily in AI development.\nSince 2013, Baidu has been working on a cutting-edge project Baidu Brain. With a strong research and development team, the project uses computer to simulate human brain and has achieved the intelligence level of a three-year-old.\nIn 2014, Baidu poured 7 billion yuan - 15 percent of its total revenues - into R&D. Last year, registered patents of Baidu also soared to nearly 2,000 items, up 146 percent compared with the previous year. And 25.4 percent is relevant to AI, including 270 items in Neuro-Linguistic Programming and 120 in Deep Learning.\n\"China's AI research and development does not lag far behind those in developed countries,\" said Baidu CEO Robin Li at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.\nBaidu's Deep Speech can recognize speech in noisy surroundings like in a restaurant as often as 81 percent, higher than the 65 percent of other commercial speech-recognition application programming interfaces, according to a Forbes report.\nAnother major breakthrough for Baidu last year was to develop software that can describe a picture with languages. This technology will allow people to search for pictures with oral instructions, and will especially benefit the blind.\nBased on its R&D, Baidu is developing applications including Baidu Magic Mirror, Carlife, self-driving cars and robots.\nWhen you get up in the morning and look into the magic mirror, it will tell you what to do with your face - shave or apply cosmetics. You can also read the news on it.\nWhen you need to go out, Carlife will tell you the best way to travel to your desired location and point out the best parking lot. The self-driving car will ferry you to the location. You can take the robot with you so that it will help you deal with various information and work and chat with or entertain you.\nLife could seem much easier in the future, especially for people with disabilities.\n","260":"AlphaGo, the computer programme developed by Google's DeepMind labs, has scored its first victory in a three-game match against the world's top player of Go, extending the machine's edge over humanity in a contest to redraw the boundary between human intelligence and the artificial variety.\n\u00a0\nKe Jie, the 19-year-old Chinese prodigy who's ranked at the game's apex, conceded in a four-and-half-hour game in Wuzhen, after AlphaGo pulled several surprise moves. \"I was shocked,\" Ke said in a post-match press conference in this waterfront town in Zhejiang province. \"Many of the moves can never happen in human competition.\"\n\nThe contest between the wunderkind and the world's smartest computer seeks to redraw the boundary where artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can surpass human endeavours, especially in strategies, plotting and the element of surprise.\n\n\"Most people view this as man versus machine, while I disagree,\" said DeepMind's founder and CEO Demis Hassabis at the tournament's kickoff. \"It is more like men using them as tools to discover new knowledge together.\"\n\nGo, also known as weiqi (   ), has been played in China since the Zhou dynasty of 1,046 to 256 BC. A two-person strategy game on a 19 X 19 grid board with black and white stones, weiqi is seen as the most complex contest played by humans.\n\nIt's been the benchmark for measuring the encroachment by artificial intelligence on human ingenuity for decades, ever since IBM's DeepBlue defeated chess master Gary Kasparov in 1997.\n\nUnlike previous computing attempts, AlphaGo uses two different neural network \"brains\" that cooperate to choose its moves. In 2016, it defeated South Korean grand master Lee Sedol, the then reigning world champion, in a 4-1 match.\n\nKe, who went professional at the age of 11,has attained the ninth dan, the game's highest level. Still, the odds are stacked against him, as he had already lost to AlphaGo during an online match in January.\n\nThere was \"only a slight chance\" for Ke to prevail, said Zheng Hong, a retired ninth-dan master, at the match. \"Artificial\u00a0intelligence can keep improving on itself by playing millions of games against itself,\" Zheng said. \"It will not be the end of the world if AlphaGo wins. No man can outrun a car, but it still means a lot to get an Olympic medal as the fastest running human.\"\n\nThe match is a milestone for technology firms like Google, Uber, Alibaba and Baidu as they are all making AI the next frontier for innovation.\n\nFor China, the birth place of weiqi, the match is particularly symbolic. Wuzhen is the site of the World Internet Conference - a showcase of the Chinese government's version of a closed, censored internet.\n\nThe applications for artificial intelligence range from voice recognition in iPhone's Siri to facial recognition in the online payment system operated by AliPay, the affiliate of Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post. The application of AI can help humans find solutions to problems they can't even begin to consider, Hassabis said.\n\n\"By collaborating with scientists, we believe AI will help create new sources of ideas to solve real-world problems,\" he said, adding the technology behind AlphaGo has already helped to reduce the energy used in Google's data centre by 40 per cent.\n\nA match in China is ripe with symbolisms, where the Chinese have considered mastery of the game one of the four essential marks of the aristocratic and scholarly classes since antiquity.\n\nKe will again play against AlphaGo tomorrow and Saturday, with each game lasting seven hours.\n\nHe played down expectations of the outcome, stressing humanity's trumph over the machine is in the game's intangible magic, instead of the bits and bytes.\n\nAlphaGo \"is after all a cold machine, and I cannot see its passion and its enthusiasm\" for the game, he said. \"I will use all my passion to have the final fight against it.

But this was the first match in four years for the AI test taker to compete. Its score was also higher than the average among liberal arts students who took the gaokao in Sichuan last year.\nShe Yujia, a student in the contest, said she felt like fighting the program on behalf of humans, especially after Google's AlphaGo beat professional Go player Lee Sedol of South Korea last year.\nResearchers who developed the AI test taker, which is also part of a project by the Ministry of Science and Technology, said the failure was due to a poor understanding of concepts in application-centered math problems such as the meaning of investment and financing.\nLin Hui, CEO of the developing company, said the program can understand more than 7,000 concepts ranging from those in elementary to high school education. With a huge knowledge database, the program can now finishes about 10 math tests a day.\nLin said more efforts will be made to fix bugs and improve performance of the program, with a focus on math application.\nThe company plans to let the AI attend the real gaokao math test along with millions of Chinese students. Like its human peers, it will be asked to complete a 150-point math test in two hours in a room without Internet access.\nChinese students are usually separated into science and liberal arts classes at high school, a practice that allows them to stay competitive in the college entrance exam by choosing preferred subjects. Math tests for liberal arts students are usually easier than those given to science students.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/72\/148985705318.jpg\nb083fe955a741a35880831.jpg\n","266":"Ideas and technologies created in China will have a bigger impact as artificial intelligence increasingly reshapes people's work and lives, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\nGoogle CEO: We want to work alongside the world's best talents\u00a0\nIdeas and technologies created in China will have a bigger impact as artificial intelligence increasingly reshapes people's work and lives, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\nPichai's comments came a day after Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook announced plans to partner with China's Tsinghua University to create a joint research center for AI-related technologies.\nThe recognition from senior executives of two of the world's most valuable companies highlights the efforts being made by China into its transformation as an innovation pioneer from an innovation sponge.\n\"When it comes to AI, we want to work alongside the world's best talents.

A visit to the recently-concluded CES Asia in Shanghai, one of the largest exhibitions for high-tech products in Asia, offered a glimpse into how far China has advanced in smart manufacturing, with Chinese firms such as Huawei, Baidu and Haier exhibiting the latest in a series of sophisticated high-tech products, including self-driving vehicles. Once a world factory known for producing low-value products, China is focusing on the next stage of its development. The \"Made in China 2025\" strategy aims to avoid \"premature deindustrialization,\" according to Richard Kozul-Wright and Daniel Poon, two senior U.N. officials who recently wrote an article on the strategy. \u00a0\n\"If it succeeds, it will have laid the institutional foundations for new sources of growth. And, as the benefits of innovation are diffused throughout the economy, China will move closer to its goal: becoming a high-income country,\" they wrote. The \"Made in China 2025\" strategy, a roadmap released by the State Council in 2015 to guide the country's advanced industrial manufacturing, has seen steady progress in industrial capability, smart manufacturing, innovation, as well as product quality and branding. A recent case in point was the home-grown passenger jet C919 that took its first test flight last month. \"The top-down design of the strategy is generally in shape, with other complementing plans going smoothly,\" according to Xin Guobin, deputy head with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. \"On the one hand, China has been increasing investment in research and development, leading to fast growth of patents and inventions, while on the other hand, the country has made breakthroughs in developing fundamental technologies, components, material and techniques,\" Xin added. Average productivity was up by 38 percent for China's first 109 pilot projects in smart manufacturing, while operating costs dropped 21 percent. The ministry has approved 12 pilot regions for the strategy, including cities such as Ningbo in Zhejiang Province and three city clusters in provinces such as Jiangsu. Some of them will be designated as national demonstration areas, which will receive favorable policies in investment, financing and other fields. \"The strategy has sometimes been portrayed as a return to old-school top-down mercantilist practices and import-substitution policies. But that reading overlooks China's active experimentation with industrial and financial policies. In fact, that experimentation may hold valuable lessons for policy evaluation and innovation elsewhere,\" according to Kozul-Wright and Poon. Still there is much room for improvement, especially in the safety and stability of some products, and China has to import high-end equipment, core chips and key materials, according to Luo Wen, another senior official with the ministry. \"China will prioritize developing new information technologies and new material, while keeping steady industrial investment, expanding consumption and promoting international capacity cooperation,\" Luo said. The European Union Chamber of Commerce claimed in a report in March that China's support for high-tech manufacturing would lead to worsening treatment of foreign companies, while allowing government-subsidized homegrown players to compete unfairly. However, many have been eager to point out that central support of such industry is a common practice worldwide. \"Government guidance and financial support towards the high-tech sector are common global practices as the market entails huge investment and poses much risk and uncertainty,\" according to Xin. \"Policies and measures under 'Made in China 2025' are applicable to both domestic and foreign businesses, and all companies will be treated equally.\" \n","273":"Events and stories coming up in the next few days\nOfficials to unveil strategy on artificial intelligence\nOn Friday, the State Council Information Office will unveil a national strategy to boost the development of artificial intelligence through 2030.

Therefore, companies engaged in emerging industries are unable to apply for business license in their specific fields.\nTo encourage new businesses of the emerging sectors, Shanghai will update the industry classification catalog every two years, according to Zhong.\nHuang Ou, deputy director of Shanghai commission of economy and information technology, growth of emerging industries contributed to over 30 percent of Shanghai economy, mainly in advanced manufacturing, science and finance, and information services.\n","279":"Chinese venture capital firms and technology giants are increasingly taking note of Canada's technology scene, with artificial intelligence as well as clean technology and life sciences some of the areas attracting interest.\nAs well as the research capabilities, the lower valuations of Canadian technology companies compared to their US counterparts make them attractive to Chinese investors, with the number of tech-related deals in Canada involving Chinese venture capital firms more than doubling to nine in 2017 from four in 2016.\nAlison Nankivell, vice-president of global expansion at BDC Capital - the venture capital arm of the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), pointed to AI research at universities in Montreal and Toronto as one area of interest, and said she was \"optimistic that high-net-worth investors from Greater China will be the next wave of investors looking at investing into Canadian companies.\"\u00a0\nThe Chinese government has set a goal of building a domestic artificial intelligence industry worth nearly US$150 billion in the next few years, and to make the country an \"innovation centre for AI\" by 2030.\nTencent Holdings, one of China's tech \"big three\" along with Baidu and Alibaba Group Holding - who are all rapidly developing their AI businesses, has already dipped its feet into the Canadian AI scene, investing in Element AI, a start-up co-founded by Montreal university academic and deep learning expert Yoshua Bengio.\nSeparately, money is also flowing into Canadian start-ups focused on other areas, including clean technology and life sciences, Nankivell said.\nFor example, Tsing Capital, a Beijing-based private equity fund, has invested in GaN Systems, which develops gallium nitride transistors for power conversion for solar and wind power grids and for electric vehicles. BDC Capital has also invested in GaN Systems through its ICE (industrial, clean and energy) technology venture fund.\nTencent has also invested in multiplatform entertainment company Wattpad, a social network platform for story writers and readers, while Baidu has this month signed a deal with former smartphone maker Blackberry to jointly develop self-driving car technology for Baidu's Apollo autonomous driving system.\nNankivell said that while no hard data was available, she believed from a rough estimate that valuations of Canadian technology companies were lower than those of their US counterparts.\n\"I would not be surprised to see that the deal valuations for the equivalent-sized companies based in Silicon Valley could be up to one-third higher, if we look at the average size of the deals being done in Canada in recent years. More intense competition for deal flows in the US has pushed up their valuations,\" she said.\nShe noted that the Canadian government is rolling out the Venture Capital Catalyst Initiative, a C$1.5 billion (US$1.2 billion) programme to develop the country's venture capital ecosystem. Under the programme, investors, including from China and Asia, will be able to invest in Canadian tech start-ups through a fund-of-fund format.\nFor the third quarter of 2017, the average size of an investment in a Canadian technology company was C$6.04 million. A total of C$980 million was invested over 149 deals for that quarter, up 43 per cent from a year earlier.\nThat brought total deal activity for the first nine months of 2017 to C$2.6 billion across 431 deals, according to figures from the Canadian Venture Capital Private Equity Association.\nFigures from Preqin, a provider of data on the alternative assets industry, showed that venture capital investment from Chinese investors was growing, with nine deals in 2017 worth a total of US$180 million, up from four deals worth around US$50 million the year before.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

[Photo provided to China Daily]\nServers are the \"engines\" to drive the flow of data in various industries. They run core business systems of finance, telecom, electricity, energy transmission and other industries that are directly related to people's livelihood.\nAccording to Wang, three of the top five global server makers are from China. The country is also playing an important part in setting worldwide industry standards.\n\"We have outpaced many countries in server patent applications, which will offer a strong momentum to growth,\" said Wang, who is also an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.\nFor a long time, China heavily relied on imports to meet the domestic demand for high-end fault-tolerant servers, which allow systems to continue running when part of the system fails, thereby avoiding loss of data. At the time, the market was dominated by IBM, HP, Fujitsu and other foreign technology providers.\nThe situation persisted until 2013, when Wang and his more than 400 colleagues successfully developed China's first proprietary 32-way high-end fault-tolerant server\uff0dthe Tiansuo K1.\nWang compared the development of Inspur Tiansuo K1 with climbing the world's second highest peak, Mount K2.\n\"When we started to develop the high-end fault-tolerant server, we named it K2 to remind every researcher of the extreme difficulties we could encounter,\" Wang said, adding the name was changed to K1 only after the team succeeded.\nEarlier this year, Inspur launched a tailor-made server platform for AI, which demands huge amounts of data computing and processing. This is the latest product of Wang and his team.\nIn the second quarter of 2017, Inspur shipped 158,000 units of servers globally, making it the world's fourth largest server maker, data from the market research company Gartner Inc show.\nFu Liang, an independent IT expert, said the technology gap between Chinese server makers and their western counterparts has been narrowed rapidly, with local players even leading the world in some respects.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/16\/150837523932.jpg\nb083fe955aa11b52204d05.jpg\n","281":"A new artificial-intelligence-powered chipset is set to help Huawei Technologies Co compete more effectively with Apple Inc in the autumn smartphone battle, when the two are scheduled to release new flagship models.\u00a0\nVisitors gather around the Huawei Stand at the International Radio exhibition held in Berlin, Germany.

It will power Huawei's upcoming Mate 10 smartphone, set to launch in October to compete with Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone, which will be unveiled next week.\nThe chip is part of Huawei's broad push to better integrate AI into its hardware, as smartphones are increasingly intertwined with the cutting-edge technology to better recognize users' voice and image, as well as understand their demand.\nYu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, said although AI work will be done in the cloud, on-device AI computation will continue to grow, with the need for sensors to operate without waiting to send any information back and forth over wireless connections.\n\"Mobile AI must be driven by both on-device AI and cloud AI. That is the focus of Huawei's AI strategy in consumer business,\" Yu said.\nHe added that consumers who attach high importance to privacy and security are also driving up demand for smartphones with built-in AI capabilities.\nHuawei, which started as a telecom equipment maker, has emerged as the world's third-largest smartphone maker in recent years, following closely behind Apple and Samsung Electronics Corp.\nThe new Kirin 970 processor is produced using an improved 10 nanometer process instead of the old 12 nanometer process. It can process data faster while using less power, Huawei said in a statement.\nJia Mo, an analyst at global consultancy Canalys, said Apple is highly likely to be working on similar AI chips.\n\"AI has been a buzzword in the smartphone sector since last year. But innovative products only started to pop up earlier this year,\" Jia said.\nHuawei has been steadily expanding its presence beyond China after it grabbed the top spot at home.

That figure ballooned to 294,000 units in 2016, when China alone ordered 87,000 units.\nThe IFR forecasts that, by 2020, more than 1.7 million new industrial robots will be installed in factories worldwide.\nJoe Gemma, president of the IFR, said: \"China is by far the biggest robot market in the world regarding annual sales and regarding the operational stock. It is the fastest-growing market worldwide. There has never been such a dynamic rise in such a short period of time in any other market.\"\nIn the UK, robots began bringing goods to workers in Amazon's warehouses in Dunstable and Doncaster last year. And British online supermarket Ocado has developed some of the world's most sophisticated machine-led warehouses for grocery goods.\nOcado does not have bricks-and-mortar shops. Instead, it takes grocery orders online and delivers produce from a network of distribution centers.\nAt Ocado's warehouse in Andover, Hampshire, a hive of stout robots the size of washing machines selects goods for online shoppers, assembling a 50-item order in minutes.\nThe robots communicate with each other as they move across a grid of grocery crates, like rooks along a chess board.\nOcado is in discussion with supermarkets in China and elsewhere that are interested in purchasing its hardware and software, which is collectively known as the Ocado Smart Platform.\nPaul Clarke, chief technology officer at Ocado Technology, said: \"The platform has been designed from day one to offer large bricks-and-mortar retailers around the world a shortcut to moving online. We've been talking to grocery retailers around the world in almost every continent. In that mix, China certainly features.\"\nE-commerce sales are set to grow by 23 percent this year, and, for the first time, will account for one-tenth of total retail sales worldwide, according to US market research company eMarketer. Last year, almost half of all global online retail sales took place in China.\nClarke said Ocado will also look to deliver the platform to a wide range of companies because the technology is not limited to grocery orders.\nOcado's main warehouse in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, reveals the timeline of the company's technological evolution.\nIn the oldest section of the warehouse, a computer program indicates to employees which goods are needed for an order. Pickers then select items manually. In a newer section, a vast network of conveyer belts and cranes controlled by an algorithm delivers goods directly to workers who sort them into bags.\nThe Ocado Smart Platform in Andover, Hampshire, is the latest iteration of the company's move toward full automation, though humans pickers are still needed to put the finishing touches to orders.\nAt Ocado's robotics lab in Hatfield, engineers are working on robotic hands that are capable of handling delicate goods without damaging them.\nThe company is also testing driverless grocery delivery vehicles, in partnership with UK-based tech company Oxbotica.\n","291":"Despite losing the second game with Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo on Thursday, Ke Jie, the 19-year-old No 1 human Go player in the world, earned praise from experts and fans for his \"incredible\" performance.\u00a0\nKe Jie reflects on his play after losing the second game of his match with AlphaGo in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, on Thursday.

Comparing the second match with the first, which he lost by half a point on Tuesday, Ke said the second was far more intense and thrilling.\n\"At one point, I thought I was very close to victory. My heart beat so fast that I pressed my hand to it, hoping it could slow down a little bit,\" Ke said.\n\"But I made bad moves later. It's really regrettable,\" he added.\nKe, the holder of multiple world titles, said AlphaGo's did not maximize some moves, giving him a chance, but he failed to take advantage of it. \"It never occurred to me that playing against a machine can be as exciting as playing against a human,\" Ke said.\nGo, which originated in ancient China, is a game in which two players take turns placing black and white stones on a 19-by-19 grid of squares to try to control the most territory.\nThe game was previously thought to be beyond the reach of computer algorithms because of its complexity, but AI has made major progress in self-learning.\nThe match is the latest showdown between the best human Go players and AlphaGo, which defeated South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol 4-1 in March 2016. The final game of the match between Ke and AlphaGo will be on Saturday.\n\"Ke had a good beginning in the game and evolved his strategy to engage in a series of complex battles across the board, but AlphaGo is too formidable,\" Chinese Go grandmaster Nie Weiping, said in an interview with the news website The Paper.\nSun Hongliang, 37, a teacher who has been playing Go for two years, said, \"No one believed Ke would win, but he still accepted the challenge.

That part, lamentably, is probably correct. Lamentably, I say, as I remain far from convinced that robots can make us humans any more content with our lives.\n\nBut what is not true is that automation will bring about 80 per cent unemployment rates.\n\nThe reason for automating rather than going with human labour is to lower the costs of production. It may also be to meet standards of quality that unaided human hands cannot meet but this was so even when a caveman first invented the chisel. It is still gratification at acceptable cost that drives these advances.\n\nAnd if the cost to you of the goods you want is lower than it was previously then you have more of your income available for spending than you did previously and you can spend it on things that you would not otherwise have bought.\n\nThis in turn creates jobs in the economy. You create jobs whenever you spend money, however you spend it. Thus any loss of employment through automation is recreated as other forms of employment when you spend the money you saved as a benefit of automation.\n\nThere are times it does not quite work this way, of course, production of weaponry being an obvious example.\n\nAdvances (if they can be called so) in the mega-tonnage of atom bombs are pure waste of effort if not used and, if used, create net job loss through death.\n\nBut what most people have in mind when they talk of jobs lost through automation is the experience they or friends have had of losing a good job and not being able to find another as their skills are no longer required.\n\nThere is no denying that it happens. Loss of work through dislocation of skills or job requirements is a price of automation and the burden of it falls heavily on older and lesser skilled people.\n\nRegrettable as this is, however, it does not say there are fewer jobs in total, only different ones.\n\nAnd then think of the mind-numbing jobs during the mid-twentieth century in \"bullpens\", office caverns with hundreds of (mostly) men squeezed in at small desks, drearily tabulating sales and survey results with pencil and paper. Gone with the wind of the digital revolution. Was that really a loss?\n\nOr think of miners hacking out coal by pick-axe in extremely dangerous conditions underground. Would we really want to deny their successors modern mining machinery?\n\nI don't know precisely what new jobs will come from automation but I can be reasonably sure that they will be mostly service jobs.\n\nThis has certainly been the history of the United States over the last 70 years, as the chart shows, and the Hong Kong data record generally shows the same trend.\n\nWe can also know from one obvious example of history that technological advance brings change rather than net loss of employment. Before the industrial revolution some 90 per cent of the world's population lived directly from agriculture. That figure is now perhaps 10 per cent.\n\nBut do we now have 80 per cent unemployment around the world as a result?\n\nNo more need we fear that we will have 80 per cent unemployment in 2030 as a result of robotics.\n","295":"China must solve the lack of theories in AI development to achieve the goal of becoming a power for artificial intelligence (AI) innovation by 2030, Turing Award-winning computer scientist Andrew Chi-Chih Yao said.\u00a0\nBEIJING -- China must solve the lack of theories in AI development to achieve the goal of becoming a power for artificial intelligence (AI) innovation by 2030, Turing Award-winning computer scientist Andrew Chi-Chih Yao said.\nIn the past 10 years, China has made great progress in AI development, but it should take the lead to make a breakthrough in AI theory development if the country wants a bigger achievement in the field, Yao said.\nHe stressed the importance of cooperation between universities and enterprises.\n\"Big companies cooperate with colleges in the U.S. and I hope that Chinese enterprises join hands with colleges for the long-term plan,\" Yao said. \"I am now focusing on AI theory development.

Advances in deep learning neural network algorithms, alongside improved computer processing power, and the abundance of big data that serves as valuable training data are all contributing to the rise of the AI industry.\u00a0\nChina's AI industry has been growing in an exponential manner. According to Tencent Research Institute, the number of AI companies has increased more than tenfold over the past 10 years, from 57 AI companies in 2007 to 592 by June 2017. Remarkably, the number of newly established AI startups in 2015 was equivalent to the total number of AI start-ups from 1999 to 2012. In terms of fundraising, according to The Economist, Chinese AI companies received $2.6 billion investment from 2012 to 2016 while US peers received $17.9 billion over the same period. However, China has been catching up quickly in recent years.\nThe Chinese government has positioned AI as a national strategic priority. China, earlier seen as a technology development laggard, aims to become a world leader in AI to drive its economic transformations with it. In the most recent government policy document outlining the New Generation AI Development Plan, the State Council, the country's Cabinet, has declared an ambitious goal of becoming a world leader in AI innovation with a market size of over 1 trillion yuan ($151.86 billion) by 2030. Policies such as Made in China 2025, the Three-year Guidance for Internet Plus AI plan, and the New Generation AI Development Plan are all top-down initiatives aiming to take the nation's AI technology forward. Furthermore, local provincial and city governments are also offering preferential policies and generous financial incentives to AI start-ups. For example, the city of Tianjin recently set up a 30 billion yuan fund to support the local AI industry.\nData is the key to unlocking the potential of AI development. With 751 million internet users and 724 million smartphone users, Chinese are embracing a 24\/7 connected lifestyle and adopting all kinds of new digital products and services. Their ubiquitous connectivity has led to tremendous amount of data that can be further monetized. And with the massive amount of training data sets as input, the AI algorithms are continuously self-tuning and improving. Companies are now able to leverage AI-enabled tools to develop a more comprehensive and dynamic understanding of their customers and competitors.\nThis vibrant innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem has also fueled China's AI development. Chinese AI-based patent applications grew 186 percent between 2010 and 2014, a huge increase from the previous five-year period. Also, in the past two years, all the top-performing teams in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, an influential AI computer vision contest, were Chinese, while half the teams were Chinese-based. Meanwhile, Internet giants such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, along with rising startups like Mobvoi, iCarbonX, Megvii and SenseTime, and unicorns like Didi Chuxing and Xiaomi are all investing in or experimenting with AI technology.\nBaidu is one of the major leaders in AI development in China. It established the Institute of Deep Learning in 2013 and the Silicon Valley AI Lab in 2014. In 2017, Baidu announced a shift in its strategy from mobile-first to AI-first, and recruited Qi Lu, a former executive vice president at Microsoft, as its new COO. In particular, it has launched an open-source platform for autonomous driving solutions, namely Project Apollo, to transform the global research and development landscape of self-driving vehicles.\nYet, China's AI industry still faces major challenges. First, China's academia is not doing much in fundamental scientific research, especially in the areas of advanced computer algorithms and computing infrastructure. So far, the majority of groundbreaking research is still being done in the West. Second, AI startups are good at launching new products and features to satisfy unmet market demand. However they primarily rely on business model innovation rather than technology innovation. Third, governments and venture capitalists tend to provide more incentives to commercial applications of technology over fundamental technology research, which takes more time and involves more risks.\nThe success of China's ambitious goal to become a world leader in AI by 2030 will hinge on the nation's innovation capabilities and long-term strategic vision. Could China eventually achieve global leadership in AI? Like everything that is related to business and technology innovations these days, it would be imprudent to count China out.\nEdward Tse is founder& CEO, Gao Feng Advisory Company, a global strategy and management consulting firm based in China and author of China's Disruptors.

And this reflects in the price: cloud computing provides the same services for 1 yuan that traditional IT companies offer for 4 yuan.\nIn July, the State Council, China's cabinet, issued guidelines on AI development, and AI projects and other areas related to AI, such as big data, cloud computing, quantum computing, and brain science, have also been proposed.\nThe guideline set three stages for AI development by 2030: catch up with the advanced global levels in AI technology and application by 2020, make major breakthroughs in basic theories by 2025, and become a global innovation center in this field by 2030. The total output value of AI industry is expected to exceed 1 trillion yuan ($151.78 billion).\nCNBC cited a report from Goldman Sachs earlier last month that the initial benefits of AI are expected to go to China's three large internet companies, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT), because they have substantial and unique data sets and have the right size of resources to take advantage of the technology.\nAlibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, announced in June that it plans to open data centers in India and Indonesia, sending its total number of data center locations to 17, which range from Chinese mainland, Australia, Germany, Japan, China's Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates to the United States.\nAt the same time, Tencent also said in April that Tencent Cloud, its cloud computing arm, will establish five more data centers this year in Silicon Valley, Frankfurt, Mumbai, Seoul and Moscow.\nHowever, Zhong Yuanhe, head of data center of Tencent technical engineering group, said to The Paper in June that the total number of servers in data centers of BAT even misses to catch up a half size of Amazon, whose subsidiary, Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides cloud computing services to businesses.\nIn addition, lack of recognized standard for these data centers is another concern.

But while such a future may indeed arrive, it remains, for the moment, a distant prospect.\nAnd yet the foreseeable frontier of computing is no less exciting. We have entered what we at IBM call the Cognitive Era. Breakthroughs in computing are enhancing our ability to make sense of large bodies of data, providing guidance in some of the world's most important decisions and potentially revolutionizing entire industries.\u00a0\nThe term \"cognitive computing\" refers to systems that, rather than being explicitly programmed, are built to learn from their experiences. By extracting useful information from unstructured data, these systems accelerate the information age, helping their users with a broad range of tasks, from identifying unique market opportunities to discovering new treatments for diseases to crafting creative solutions for cities, companies and communities.\nThe Cognitive Era marks the next stage in the application of science to understand nature and advance human prosperity. Its beginning dates to early 2011, when the cognitive computing system Watson beat two human champions on Jeopardy!, a game show.\nBroadly, cognitive systems offer five core capabilities. First, they create deeper human engagement, using data about an individual to create more fully human interactions. Second, they scale and elevate expertise, learning from experts in various fields and making that know-how available to people. Third, they provide products, such as those connected to the \"internet of things\", with the ability to sense the world around them and to learn about their users. Fourth, they allow their operators to understand large amounts of data, helping manage workflows, providing context, and allowing for continuous learning, better forecasting and improved operational effectiveness. And, finally\uff0dperhaps most important\uff0dthey allow their users to perceive patterns and opportunities that would be impossible to discover through traditional means.\nCognitive systems are inspired by the human brain, an organ that still has much to teach us. Today, computers consume about 10 percent of the world's electricity output, according to Mark Mills, CEO of the Digital Power Group. To benefit fully from the Cognitive Era, we will have to be able to harness huge amounts of information; during the next 15 years, the amount of \"digitally accessible\" data is expected to grow by a factor of more than 1,000. Performing the calculations necessary for using such a large amount of data will not be possible without huge strides in improving energy efficiency.\nMatching the performance and efficiency of the human brain will likely require us to mimic some of its structures, for which we can arrange computer components in a dense 3D matrix similar to a human brain, maximizing not performance, but energy efficiency.\nArranging computer chips in a 3D environment puts the various elements of the computer closer to one another. This reduces the time they take to communicate and improves energy efficiency by a factor of as much as 5,000, potentially providing computers with efficiency close to that of a biological brain.\nBut man-made computers are so inefficient not only because they need to power the chips, but also because they need energy to run the air conditioners that remove the heat generated by the processors. The human brain has a lesson to teach here as well. Just as the brain uses sugar and blood to provide energy and cooling to its various regions, a 3D computer could use coolant fluid to deliver energy to the chips.\nBy adopting some of the characteristics of the human brain, computers have the potential to become far more compact, efficient and powerful. And this, in turn, will allow us to take full advantage of cognitive computing\uff0dproviding our real brains with new sources of support, stimulus and inspiration.\nThe author is a scientist at IBM Research, Zurich.\nProject Syndicate\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/64\/147005672957.png\na41f72773d1b1908d6c00e.png\n","309":"More than a year since it made a strategic pivot to artificial intelligence, Microsoft Corp has stepped up efforts to empower tens of thousands of software developers around the world to create smarter applications for businesses and consumers.\u00a0\n\nThat could enable Microsoft, the world's largest software company, to remain more relevant than ever in the mainland, where the market for AI applications is predicted to become the fastest-growing globally.\n\n\"There are plenty of opportunities,\" Harry Shum Heung-yeung, the executive vice-president of Microsoft's artificial intelligence and research group, said in a recent interview with the South China Morning Post. \"Our approach is very simple: we are here to democratise access to AI.\"\n\nShum, who was one of the founding members of Beijing-based Microsoft Research Asia in 1998, currently leads a global team of roughly 7,000 computer scientists and engineers focused on the company's AI initiatives.\n\nAfter 60 years of development, AI has entered a new phase of accelerated growth, driven by major advances in computing power, the development of powerful machine learning and deep learning algorithms, and an explosion in data that can be fed into these algorithms, according to global consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nMachine learning is a type of AI focused on computer programmes that have the ability to learn when exposed to new data, while deep learning is an AI function that imitates how the human brain works in processing data to make decisions.\n\nMicrosoft this month started offering a broader set of so-called cognitive services to more than half a million developers around the world that currently use its AI platform.

To be sure, Lenovo has expanded its market share. But it has to keep profit margins low to compete in a market that's shrinking rather than expanding.\nMeanwhile, Lenovo's major competitors in the US are moving ahead to explore the next big boom in data collection to build platforms for the development of artificial intelligence. Dell, for instance, has agreed to buy EMC Corp, a dominant player in storage devices, for a whopping $67 billion. Hewlett Packard has invested in a San Francisco company Mesosphere which found a way to operate among various corporate and public clouds, according to the New York Times. Mesosphere raised $73.5 million last month, the Times said.\nIn an article published in The South China Morning Post, Cao Jiannong, a computer science professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, explained that the investment payoff in cloud computing comes from insights gained from a huge amount of data. Machine learning software, or artificial intelligence, can drill down into the data to discover and analyze information that can help people make decisions, he writes.\nThe business opportunities arising from cloud computing are said to be immense. \"Just teaching companies how to use AI (artificial intelligence) will be a big business,\" predicted Diane Green, head of Google Computer Engine, in the Times' article.\nIn streamlining its business, a necessary move, Lenovo appears to have kept its product-centric business strategy at a time when the latest hardware-driven tech boom is fizzling out. Global demand for personal computers, smartphones and other hand-held devices is slipping fast. Even mighty Apple is finding it increasingly difficult to sell its iconic iPhones fast enough.\nLenovo has to show that it's ready to tap into the cloud computing boom to buttress investor confidence. It has got to move fast in this direction to stay relevant.\n(HK Edition 04\/01\/2016 page9)\n","311":"The head of Baidu Inc has pledged to shift the company's business from a search-oriented model to one based on artificial intelligence, after a recent government probe put a chill on its core search business.\u00a0\nBaidu's logo shown on its website on May 9, 2016.[Photo\/IC]\nThe head of Baidu Inc has pledged to shift the company's business from a search-oriented model to one based on artificial intelligence, after a recent government probe put a chill on its core search business.\nBaidu CEO Li Yanhong said in an internal letter on Tuesday that the shift will allow the company to develop such areas as voice search, automatic translation and driverless vehicles.\nLi, who is a co-founder of Baidu, which runs China's largest online search engine, also vowed to emphasize user experience over income and to set up a department to root out any behavior that might damage user experience.\n\"The department will have the final say to veto any behavior that is not in line with a good user experience,\" Li said in the letter, which Baidu made public later on Tuesday. \"Some of the measures we take may have a negative impact on the company's income. But I believe it is the right thing to do.\"\nAnalysts said the move is expected to dampen Baidu's near-term profitability, which in turn would make it more challenging for the company's new business initiative to gain momentum.\nThe vow to put users ahead of business performance came after a government investigation led to a demand that the search giant overhaul its paid listing system. The probe came after the death of Wei Zexi, a 21-year-old college student, who underwent an experimental medical treatment that had been advertised among Baidu's search results.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China, which launched a joint investigation of Baidu with other authorities last week, said on Monday that the company had \"influenced the impartiality and objectivity of its search results, making it easy to mislead users, and this must be immediately rectified.\"\nIn response to the government's demand, Baidu said on Monday that it will restrict the proportion of sponsored search results to 30 percent per web page and adopt a new listing system that does not fully depend on the advertising price, but also considers advertisers' \"reputation\".\nOther actions include placing clear disclaimers on advertisements, so that online users can tell them apart from natural search results, and establishing a 1 billion yuan ($153.4 million) fund to compensate netizens cheated by false promotions.\nIndustry observers said the moves are likely to hurt Baidu's short-term profitability, since medical-related ads are estimated to account for 25 percent of its revenue.\nLyu Ronghui, analyst with internet consultancy iResearch, said Baidu's revenue is likely to decline in the near future because the company will have to turn down some medical-related ads and might also spend more money to verify the qualifications of medical organizations or enterprises.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/54\/146292912489.jpg\nb083fe955a0f189caeba09.jpg\n","312":"China's largest Uber-like freight service provider will step up its investment into artificial intelligence, as it scrambles to tap into the new technology to boost efficiency in matching empty trucks with loads.\u00a0\nManbang Group created by merger of major players in sharing economy\nChina's largest Uber-like freight service provider will step up its investment into artificial intelligence, as it scrambles to tap into the new technology to boost efficiency in matching empty trucks with loads.\nManbang Group, which was created last November after China's top two truck-calling apps Huochebang and Yunmanman merged, has already set up an AI laboratory in Silicon Valley, in the hope of accessing cutting-edge technologies and top talent, said Xu Qiang, vice-president of Yunmanman.

The number for Yunmanman is 4 million and 1 million respectively, with its services available in 334 cities across China.\nThe two companies, which announced a merger plan in November, were both major players in China's trucking market, which is estimated to be worth 5 trillion yuan ($776 billion). They allow shippers to post load information on mobile applications and connect them with truck drivers, so as to reduce a truck's empty miles and waiting time between loads.\nThe marriage is considered an effective move to end a costly battle, as the two players are seen as such close rivals that no winner was likely in the short term.\n\"Instead of fighting at each other's expense, we figure it is far better for us to devote more time and energy to upgrading ourselves.

For example, big data and system automatic decision-making engines have accelerated the process of issuing bank loans, said Xue Min, general manager of financial services at JD Power China.\nIndustry players have cut the waiting period between loan applications and car pickup with loans to a mini-mum of 500 seconds, compared with 8.79 days two years ago, said Xue.\nChina, the world's largest automobile market for eight consecutive years, manufactured 28.12 million cars and sold 28.03 million units in 2016, up 14.5 percent and 13.7 percent respectively, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\nHowever, according to JD Power's estimates, new automobile sales in China will slow down in the next couple of years.\nIn the past five years, along with soaring sales of passenger vehicles, Ping An Bank's auto finance division has seen its business scale expanding 10 times to 100 billion yuan, said Fu Zhongqiang, president of the auto finance division at Ping An Bank.\nFu said the auto finance sector is expected to be a key profit contributor to Ping An's retail business.\nThough China's car financing market remains in its infancy, many young Chinese consumers are willing to buy cars on mortgages. However, the industry still lags behind its counterparts in the United States and Europe where between 70 percent and 80 percent of cars are purchased on credit, said Zhang Xu'an, CEO of Yixin Group, a leading Chinese online automobile transaction platform.\n\"More than 35 percent of Chinese automobiles were sold last year through financing and leasing, and we expect the figure to rise to 45 percent by the end of this year,\" said Zhang.\nNearly 30 percent of car purchases in China in 2015 were on credit, up from 18 percent in 2013, according to a Deloitte report, which predicted China's penetration rate of auto retail finance products to cross 50 percent by 2020.\n\"Buying cars at a traditional dealership often means more time and higher cost than buying online due to the limited availability of car models, lack of information, long transaction period and insufficient services,\" said Zhao Xiang, an analyst from Analysys, a domestic internet research firm.\nAccording to Zhao, online automobile transaction platforms have stimulated car buying demand as they offer Chinese consumers an opportunity to buy their dream car with low down payments.\n\"There is not enough data available about new car trading, but the available used car online trading data do give us some insights of internet's involvement in the automobile trading business,\" said Zhao.\nAccording to Zhao, 10.39 million used vehicles were traded throughout 2016, up 10.3 percent year-on-year.\nwang_ying@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 12\/19\/2017 page16)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/100\/151364460725.jpg\na41f726b05111ba2982f12.jpg\n","317":"China is ramping up its efforts to develop artificial intelligence in manufacturing to boost its productivity as well as create new momentum in the future market.\nA visitor shakes hands with a robot during a science and technology week in Beijing.

So will an intelligent phone be the next great breakthrough?\nFiercely competitive smartphone market shifts focus from hardware features to virtual brainpower\u00a0\nZhao Ming, president of Huawei's Honor Brand, delivers a speech at the launch ceremony for their AI phone Honor V10. [PHOTO PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY]\nMany commentators have deemed 2017 to be year one for the artificial intelligence smartphone as iPhone X and Honor V10 launched into the highly competitive but uniform cellphone market. So will an intelligent phone be the next great breakthrough?\nThe smartphone competition battlefield has shifted from pursuit of super-slimness, dual-cameras, fast-charging to full screen, yet none of these hardware features lies at the core of phone manufacturers' competitiveness, explained Zhao Ming, president of Honor - a phone brand of Huawei.\nAccording to a China Academy of Information and Communications Technology report, cellphone shipments by domestic brands reached 3.19 million in October, down 15.4 percent year on year. Similar features and designs make domestic smartphone players swim in the highly competitive, margin-eroding \"Red Ocean\".\nThe smartphone market's future lies in the prospect that an intelligent handset can serve as a personal assistant for users' daily lives, taking care of their needs and letting amateurs become masters, empowered by state-of-the-art AI technology.\nLast month Honor launched its full-screen V10 smartphone with AI-enabled chipset in Beijing. The new handset promises fresh, exciting AI features; it supports face-unlock technology - the screen will light up automatically when the owner gazes at it.\nThe phone can identify 13 kinds of scene and improve parameters in photo shooting and video recording. The more consumers use the AI-empowered phone, the more data it collects. The handset in your pocket will know you better and function in a more nuanced way to make your life easier.\nYounger appeal\nHonor, launched four years ago in 2013, has thrived by taking advantage of its parent company Huawei's well-established name.\nThe brand, which sells its products primarily online, has issued several flagship phones which have been well-received by the market; it has become a pioneer in the intelligent phone field.\n\"We give unique identities to Huawei and Honor. Huawei Mate are our flagship phones that boast upscale business style, while many of the functions we put in Honor are appealing to young people,\" noted Zhao.\nHighlights of the latest model include 30 sets of mobile phone WLAN co-broadcast music and optimizing performance when the users play the smash-hit game King of Glory.\nThe cost-effective internet business model has let the brand sell models to younger consumers at 1,000 yuan ($151) to 3,000 yuan.\nHonor V10 is priced at 2,699 yuan for the 4GB RAM\/64GB internal storage variant and 3,499 yuan for 6GB RAM\/128GB internal storage variant.\nAI speed revolution\nThe AI smartphone became a buzzword when iPhone launched its latest gadget, iPhone X. The iPhone X's \"original deep camera\" achieves facial recognition by sensing the depth of the user's face and modeling it with 300,000-point clouds to achieve high precision.\nThere is at present no consensus on defining an AI smartphone. But the growing consensus among researchers is that AI smartphones should have end-to-end capability from AI chips that can conduct AI processing on the mobile devices; an AI algorithm that enables deep learning; cloud services and an AI system.\nHonor V10's Kirin 970 AI chip is designed to be used in smartphones. The Kirin 970 is custom-made to conduct such tasks as sorting images, translating text and understanding speech.\n\"It's a game with very few players,\" Zhao said.\nIn 2012, Honor began its AI research. Last year it released the first AI cellphone, Honor Magic. Honor V10 AI is a complete upgrade to Magic. Zhao said years of accumulation in this field had given Honor first-mover advantage.\n\"The Honor V10 we launched today has functions and capacity that no other phone can even achieve in half year,\" Zhao said with confidence in the launch.\nHonor V10 uses EMUI8.0 AI system which based on AI 2.0. It switches context with homogenous multi-core. With revolutionary system, the fluency can be much improved.\n\"AI knows you better\", \"AI speed revolution\" is integrated into Honor's campaign; Zhao thinks AI phones comprise the future market.\n\"For the past years, when we talk about the speed of smartphones, we are thinking about hardware. Yet the improvement in hardware has reached a bottleneck; even when the processing speed doubled, it brought negligible differences of fractions of seconds to users.\n\"The moment we had an idea in mind, we are already operating our phone, if we respond to such a request from the users' minds we can streamline the process significantly,\" Zhao said.\nTaking the parameter camera setting as an example - using AI, people who have no knowledge of photo-shooting can snap pictures that mirror those taken by professional photographers.\n\"I think that is the beauty of AI smartphone, that you can be more engaged in many facets of life effortlessly,\" Zhao said.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/10\/151901574127.jpeg\n5a2e473ba310eefe3b502914.jpeg\n","339":"DJI Technology, the world's largest consumer drone maker in terms of market share, has unveiled its new product equipped with artificial intelligence to Chinese users on Saturday.\nDJI's latest product Phantom 4, which can aviod obstacles and tracks objects, is unveiled in Shenzhen, March 5, 2016.

Now that Google has become an investor, it gives both sides more possibilities to work together,\" Li said.\nDon Harrison, vice-president of corporate development for Google, said in a statement Google decided to invest in Mobvoi because of its \"unique\" speech and natural language processing technologies.\nBut the Chinese company's ability to support Google in its push for wearable operating system Android Wear gave the US company another reason to write the check, it is learned.\nMobvoi developed Ticwear, the first Chinese-language operating system used on wearable devices. Because Google's own Android Wear system is not fully available on the Chinese mainland, Ticwear could be an appropriate substitute.\nTicwear is already comparable with a wide spectrum of Android Wear apps. The Chinese company also makes smart watches that can install Android apps.\nGoogle's investment in Mobvoi is its first in China since 2010. Joan Wang, managing director at venture capital firm SIG Asia Investment, said Google will help Mobvoi further commercialize its products as well as expand overseas.\nGoogle pulled its major services - including online search, e-mail and mapping - out of the Chinese mainland five years ago due to disagreements over industry regulations.\nChinese players such as Baidu Inc quickly dominated the massive market the US company vacated.\nGoogle has never completely abandoned the Chinese mainland market though. It kept a fairly large engineering and sales team in Beijing even at its lowest point.\nCurrently, the company's major service in China involves helping Chinese companies launch online advertisements overseas.\nBut after missing out on the high double-digit growth of Chinese smartphone market since 2010, Google appears to have decided to return to the world's largest Internet market full throttle, some industry observers said.\nSome local Android app developers had said Google may announce its plans to return to the Chinese mainland in coming months.

The AI chipset enables the new device's cameras to identify 13 sorts of objects, such as people and plants, when being photographed, and to adjust the settings such as correction filters in accordance with the surrounding environment.\nFang Fang, a 24-year-old bank employee from Shanghai, said: \"I often take selfies. Thus, the new function of Huawei smartphone is like adding a Doraemon (a popular Japanese cartoon character) as the camera will optimize itself no matter if it is rainy or windy.\"\nAnother highlight of Huawei's AI-enabled function is that the new phone copes with the degrading performance of Android system, which has been seen as a bottleneck for years. The Shenzhen-based company said Mate 10 can run smoothly for a far longer time than its previous handsets.\nHuawei's new handset came just a few weeks before the much-expected shipment date of Apple's iPhone X, which also boasts a slate of fancy AI features such as using face recognition to unlock smartphones. In comparison, Huawei sticks to finger recognition technology with Mate 10.\nXiang Ligang, a smartphone expert and CEO of telecom industry website Cctime, said smartphones are becoming increasingly similar in both design and hardware, as technology advances are helping vendors access high-end components at affordable costs.\n\"AI is definitely the next big thing, but handset makers are still fumbling on how to integrate it into existing systems. Huawei's Mate 10, though less advanced than expected, can be a good challenger for the iPhone X,\" Xiang said.\nAccording to Jia from Canalys, more efforts are needed from Huawei, especially in terms of attractive user cases, when introducing new features, just like what Apple has done with the iPhone X.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/7\/150828915270.jpg\nb083fe955aa11b50cff304.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/65\/150828915280.jpg\nb083fe955aa11b50d01f05.jpg\n","343":"Chinese tech giant Xiaomi Corp announced on Thursday it would build an open artificial intelligence platform for Mi TV products, with the aim of offering users a better voice control experience.\u00a0\nWang Chuan, co-founder of Xiaomi Corp, introduces the latest Mi TV 4 at a product launch in Beijing on May 18.

The US topped that list with an estimated US$17.9 billion in investments in the same period.\nBaidu, China's online search market leader, has pushed hard into AI by developing its own autonomous driving system and an AI team of more than 1,300 experts spread across the mainland and the US.\nAI initiatives at e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba, which owns the Post, are led by subsidiary Alibaba Cloud.

In particular, his experience at Microsoft and background in artificial intelligence allows him to take a more active role in operations and frees up [Robin Li] to work more on strategic issues,\" said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research, which has a \"neutral\" recommendation on the stock.\n\"We also think this highlights Baidu's focus on new technologies moving forward as the choice of COO does not appear to give special consideration to the core search segment. And that makes sense as we expect growth in the search business to moderate as the move to mobile has resulted in a more competitive market for advertising budgets from social media platforms like Weixin, QQ and Weibo,\" he said.\nBaidu has been actively developing AI technology in recent years\nRicky Lai, analyst with Guotai Junan\nBoodry added that his firm is not changing the neutral rating as it is still cautious on the stock because of slower search revenue growth, a situation that has not changed.\nBaidu's top down decision-making process slowed down strategy execution and has seen the company fall behind rivals Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group in the shift towards the mobile internet. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nBaidu's market valuation is currently about one quarter that of its main competitors, especially after its core online advertising business took a big hit after the death of a young cancer patient who sought an alternative treatment advertised on a Baidu link. The scandal tainted Baidu's image and prompted the government to step up controls over paid online listings.\nLast week, Baidu appointed former Microsoft executive Lu Qi , a leading expert in artificial intelligence, as its group president and chief operating officer, giving the software industry veteran oversight over all aspects of Baidu's business from sales to technology development.\n\"I want to gradually take the day-to-day management work off my shoulders,\" Li said at a media briefing at the company's headquarters in Beijing. \"I think I will be spending a little more time on investing.\"\nThe sense of crisis and the desire to get Baidu back on top of its game pushed Melissa Ma, Li's wife, to rejoin the company as a special assistant to the chairman. Ma, who introduced herself as Li's life companion for 21 years and business partner for 16 years, asked in an internal meeting last week: \"We were the largest internet company by valuation in China. What happened in the past four years?\"\nBy taking the vice president-level role, she said she hopes to act as \"a bridge between everyone and Robin\", ensuring that strategies are executed in a timely manner.\nOne of the biggest strategies Baidu has been pursuing is artificial intelligence, an area in which it holds advantages in talent and technology and has made aggressive moves to apply the technology to driverless cars.\nLu, the architect behind the artificial intelligence and bots strategy at Microsoft, is seen as an ideal person to steer Baidu towards its new growth phase.\n\"I think Lu Qi can bring his experience in developing AI to Baidu's platform. Baidu has been actively developing AI technology in recent years and it can benefit from his expertise and experience related to AI,\" said Ricky Lai, an analyst with Guotai Junan.\nThe changes are expected to have a positive impact on the company but insiders and analysts remain cautious on whether the new management team can develop the required chemistry to make Baidu great again.\nYin Sheng, an independent analyst who has followed China's internet sector for nearly a decade, said the management changes will fuel Baidu's new drive to seek growth powered by artificial intelligence.\n\"The reshuffle in management provides Baidu the entrepreneurial spirit, the industry vision and the revolutionary management style it needs for its shift to AI,\" he said.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

In Artificial Intelligence, for example, they can provide services including prostitution, and comfort a heartbroken mother by being her child.\nRobots deliver dishes to customers at Robot Restaurant in Harbin, Heilongjiang province. [Photo provided to China Daily]\nRobots in sci-fi movies are almost omnipotent. In Artificial Intelligence, for example, they can provide services including prostitution, and comfort a heartbroken mother by being her child.\u00a0\nIn the animated film Wall-E, human beings give up the Earth and live in a man-made space city, served completely by robots: driverless cars, cleaning robots, repairing robots and armed robot guards. Human beings need not work at all, but are fed like babies who cannot even walk on feet.\nReal life is not so far away from movies. We already have robots that can clean floors. In Northeast China, robots take over from cooks to slice noodles. In late March, a restaurant in Beijing's Daxing district started to use robots as waiters and waitresses to cut down costs.\nIn the US, when protesters were calling for fast-food chains to raise wages, many restaurants were experimenting with robots to reduce employees.\nIn July 2014, the Associated Press started using software to help journalists to write business news faster. In early March this year, the news agency announced a new software called Wordsmith that will help generate college sports news that it had not covered before.\nOnce self-driving cars are put into wide use in the future, millions of taxi drivers around the world will lose their job. As robotic science and technology advance, robots will inevitably replace human beings to do more jobs. Some people are worried that the large-scale application of robots will result in an unprecedented unemployment crisis. However, scientists say there is no need to worry unduly.\nIn September 2013, two researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne from the University of Oxford, released a research report titled \"The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerization?\"\nThey estimated the probability of computerization for 702 occupations and concluded that about 47 percent of total US employment is at risk.\nBut in an e-mail reply to China Daily, Osborne, associate professor in machine learning, says: \"There will certainly be new jobs created by advances in technology, alongside the many benefits afforded to all consumers by the development of increasingly cheap and fantastic products.\"\n\"Nonetheless, our study highlights the potential risks of automation to low-skilled workers, who will likely be ill-equipped to move into the new occupations that do emerge: travel agents put out of work by web services may not be able to get jobs as data scientists,\" he says.\nThe replacement of low-skilled workers by robots seems to have started.\nIn 2012, Amazon acquired Kiva Systems to develop robots for its logistics chains. Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, announced in May last year that the company would employ 10,000 robots at the end of 2014, much more than the 1,400 robots at that time.\nLately, Rethink Robotics created the one-armed robot Sawyer based on its analysis of 150 factory tasks. The 3.3-foot tall robot, which sells for $29,000, has a super-flexible limb that can complete intricate tasks without tiring. The creator said they are aiming at the electronics assembly industry, most of which is in Asia.\nLabor costs can be high. In China, since 2001, worker's wages have been growing at an annual rate of 12 percent, according to Bloomberg. Moreover, many coastal factories have to face the worsening shortage of workers.\nIn 2013, China became the world's largest market for industrial robots.\nStatistics from International Federation of Robotics showed that China bought 56,000 out of the 227,000 industrial robots, the world's total in 2014, up 53 percent compared with in 2013.\nCoastal provinces like Zhejiang and Guangdong are planning to replace human labor with robots.\nIn March, Guangdong province announced a three-year subsidiary plan for the 2,000 biggest manufacturers to purchase robots. According to the plan, Guangzhou, the capital city, will have 80 percent of its factories automated by 2020.\nHon Hai Group, the producer of iPhones, which has about 1 million employees in the mainland, announced in March the plan to use thousands of robots to replace its human labor force. CEO Terry Guo said that within three years, 70 percent of Hon Hai's assembly lines would be automated.\nDomestic home appliances giant Midea also said in March that it will lay off 6,000 workers out of a total of 30,000 in 2015 and install automated assembly lines instead. In 2018, it will ax another 4,000 workers.\nChina has the world's biggest labor resources, but is now also the world's largest market for industrial labor. Meanwhile, there are still many low income workers.\n\"They are not contradictory. Instead, we need to change our opinion about robots,\" says Zhu Shiqiang, director of Robotics Research Center of Zhejiang University.\n\"Industrial robots are not dispensable tools. In many fields like the auto and electronic industries, they are indispensable,\" he says.\n\"If factories don't use robots, they cannot compete with other producers in quality, efficiency and cost,\" he points out.\nIn many industries, robots have not been widely used or used at all, so it is a matter of time when more factories in China will be automated. But scientists are generally confident that humans will keep up with robots.\n\"Unless human beings use it in a wrong way, like we did with nuclear technology, the advancement of science and technology has never led to regression of human development,\" Zhu says.\nWang Shuo, a researcher at the Institute of Automation with the China Academy of Sciences, says as a scientific worker, he believes that robots are equipment that will serve people, and help people to improve their living standards and avoid danger or threats.\nTo investigate the situation in the abandoned Fukushima nuclear power plant that was damaged severely in an earthquake in 2011, Tokyo Electric Power Company said recently that it would send another robot to do the job that had not been finished by the previous one, which fell down and had exhausted its power.\nFor manufacturing industries, using robots is an inevitable trend when they have developed to a certain stage.\nWhether or not there will be more newly-created jobs for human beings or not, for robotic researchers and builders, and also for most robot users, \"we need robots to replace the tedium and drudgery of routine work, to enable us to make best use of our most quintessentially human skills: creativity and social intelligence,\" Osborne says.\n\"Put another way, machines allow us to become fully human,\" he says.\n","350":"Social networking and artificial intelligence will be the future for Sohu.com, said Zhang Chaoyang, the internet company's chairman and chief executive.\nZhang Chaoyang, chairman and CEO of Sohu.com, speaks during an interview in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, Nov 16, 2016.

The billionaire AI-skeptic is worried that humans could accidentally stumble onto technologies that could lead to their own destruction. As early as 2014, he described AI as humankind's biggest existential threat.\nSimilar warnings have been sounded by Stephen Hawking.\nSome tech innovators are more relaxed. Ray Kurzweil, a leading tech developer, is confident that sensible controls can head off the prospect of nightmare scenarios. He has cited advances in biotechnology, which was once regarded as a potential threat by those alarmed by the prospect of scientists tampering with human DNA.\nKurzweil has written that biotech guidelines established over several decades had worked very well. \"There have been no significant problems, accidental or intentional, for the past 39 years,\" he wrote in a 2014 blog. \"We are now seeing major advances in medical treatments reaching clinical practice and thus far none of the anticipated problems.\"\nThe arguments of Kurzweil and others that humans have faced existential challenges in the past and somehow overcome them are comforting. Most innovations since the dawn of time have had a potential for good and evil. The caveman's spear could be used to catch dinner or annihilate his neighbor.\nThe four great inventions of ancient China were the compass, paper, printing and gunpowder. It's another matter that we might be better off if the last one had been reserved for making fireworks rather than being developed by others for the industrialization of war.\nBut, as most of us would concede, you can't stop progress. AI will sooner or later become a reality, and one positive sign is that scientists worldwide are collaborating to ensure it is not misused.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology began collaborating with Tsinghua University and other Chinese institutions over the past decade on AI and other high-tech fields. In a 2010 report, MIT said: \"If we are going to be involved in the resolution of global problems\uff0dwhether sustainable cities, climate change, resource depletion, disease control or any other\uff0dwe have to be able to understand and engage partners in China.\"\nWith China set to take the lead in AI research, it and its international partners will also be looking at the potential disruptive consequences of the new technology in terms of job replacement and global security.\nAs Fei-Fei Li, AI expert and chief scientist of Google Cloud, recently told Xinhua News Agency, AI could be used to benefit humanity or cause it big problems. Everyone should be involved in the debate, she said. \"Silicon Valley leaders, professors, students, policymakers, lawmakers, educators ... everybody should be at the table discussing this.\"\nThe author is a senior editorial consultant for China Daily. harveymorris@gmail.com\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/20\/150189497490.jpg\nb083fe955fbe1aef57a513.jpg\n","355":"At least a dozen developers are introducing products that use artificial intelligence to scour social-media posts in China for comments about shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.\nInvestors surf the internet at a brokerage in Beijing.

They also talk about stocks, and that has entrepreneurs listening.\nAt least a dozen developers are introducing products that use artificial intelligence to scour social-media posts in China for comments about shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. The software searches for keywords and then distills its findings into summaries of whether investors are positive or negative about particular companies.\nIndividuals comprise the majority of investors in China's $6.4-trillion stock market, and institutional traders want tools to find out which ways the retail crowd are leaning before making their own decisions.\nPrograms such as Market Mood, FinSentS and WiseEnterprise that analyze internet forums are part of the $1.2 billion spent annually by financial-services firms on market-data feeds, according to consulting firm Greenwich Associates.\n\"If you see the Chinese stock market, people just react to any news flow coming from WeChat, Weibo or any type of social media,\" said Kevin Leung, director for global investment strategy at Haitong International Securities Group Ltd in Hong Kong. \"There is definitely an impact on stocks.\"\nThe programs also help investors follow company-generated posts on Weibo, the most popular of China's Twitter-like microblogging platforms. Twitter and Facebook are not available in China, giving rise to local counterparts from Weibo Corp and Tencent Holdings Ltd, operator of WeChat.\nOther Chinese social-media networks being scraped include Minkabu Inc's Caiku and East Money, which host blogs about stock trading. The Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges have a combined 111 million investor accounts, according to China Securities Depository and Clearing Corp data. There are about 80 billion social-media posts a year on China's internet.\nChina Market Mood was developed by Berkeley, California-based startup Pluribus Labs LLC, which already offers a \"sentiment analytics\" product in the US. The Chinese version will be released this month, and the company plans to open an office in the region by year-end, Chief Executive Officer Frank Freitas said.\n\"The Chinese market is increasingly a bellwether for moves in other markets, not just in the Asian region but in other regions,\" Freitas said. \"Given the high degree of retail-investor involvement in this market, maintaining a timely understanding of the tenor of these participants can provide valuable insights.\"\nWeibo, which counts Sina Corp and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd as shareholders, had an average of 126 million daily active users in June - a 36 percent increase from a year earlier, according to a company statement.\nThe companies interviewed for this story declined to comment on their revenue from market sentiment products and how much they have spent on their development.\nThe efforts to scan Chinese investor sentiment comes amid a downturn in the mainland's markets. The benchmark Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index has fallen 13 percent this year after a 9.4 percent gain in 2015.\nMarket Mood uses a proprietary dictionary compiled through machine learning to search posts for words such as bullish, bearish, gap and rip, Freitas said. The program also scans for pairs of words that denote positive or negative values.\nThe software compiles what Freitas calls a sentiment score. That number is tallied for specific periods of time to meet the requests of clients, who may want to target certain industries.\nNews sentiment analysis, including that provided by Bloomberg LP, Thomson Reuters Corp and other news and data providers, is being increasingly used by investors.\nFreitas has worked in the financial services industry for 25 years, including as chief operating officer for Instinet LLC.

Zhou said he believes the rapid development of AI, robotics, intelligent machines, big data and cloud computing will bring revolutionary changes to the wine industry as well as a wide range of traditional industries.\nThe chateau is a pilot project of Hefu's AI and robotic technologies that are applied in changing traditional production methods.\nIt also marks the company's global expansion. Zhou said Chinese robotics companies can go global in various ways.\nThe one Hefu prefers is by introducing robots developed by the company into the properties it buys in foreign countries.\n\"It can become our overseas base and serve as an example for other properties in the foreign market,\" Zhou said.\nChinese robotics companies can use other routes.\" One way is to introduce low-priced robots that can perform simple but reliable functions in markets of economies involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. Another is to use competitively priced high-end robots to enter developed markets,\" Zhou said.\nHe, however, stressed only Chinese companies that excel in the domestic market would succeed globally. \"It's because the foreign market is more complex, be it in terms of application level or technology level.\"\nOne concern is that Chinese companies still rely on imported core components, Zhou said. \"We are trying to solve this problem with our technologies and intellectual property rights, but it'll take time.\"\nZhou believes existing bottlenecks can be removed in three to five years as the government has attached great importance to the industry.\nHe said Chinese robotics companies have started showcasing their creations at this year's WRC.\n\"Two years ago, when the conference was held for the first time, we were not confident. For us, it was more like an open platform where we could broaden our horizons and learn from foreign companies,\" Zhou said.\nThings have changed since then. Some of the most appealing robots at the event were made by Chinese companies.\nZhou said Chinese companies appear to have positioned themselves more precisely in the world market than others, on the back of confidence arising from success in a huge market like China.\nChina's robotics industry will be worth $6.28 billion this year, after exceeding $5 billion for the first time in 2016, according to the International Federation of Robotics.\nA Bloomberg Intelligence report said China bought 90,000 robots in 2016, almost a third of the global total.\n\"While developed countries are leading the world in electronic information technologies and robot designs, we have broader applications and market feedback in China,\" Zhou said.\n\"A big market means enormous vitality, which then enables the industry to adjust orientation and upgrade products according to the real demand.\"\nHe said no one can predict who will be the real giants in the future\uff0dand that's the charm of the industry.\nVietnam will be Hefu's next foreign destination, Zhou said.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/85\/150630180273.jpg\na41f726b08411b3285770d.jpg\n","357":"The first World Intelligence Congress started Thursday, with 16 forums and a 6,000-square-meter exhibition area displaying achievements in artificial intelligence.\nRobots are displayed during the first World Intelligence Congress in Tianjin, June 29, 2017.

In terms of mobile payments, China has a transaction value 11 times that of the United States.\n\"The digital economy is making greater contribution to the national economy and rising as a fresh driver of economic transformation and upgrades,\" said Lin Xiunian, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planner.\nGrowth points\nAt the recent three-day Central Economic Work Conference, China's policymakers pledged to steer the economy onto a new path featuring high-quality rather than high-speed growth.\nDigital technology will give a push to the shift, revitalizing sluggish sectors and creating new growth points.\n\"China will briskly foster new growth drivers, improve technological innovation, push for upgrades of traditional sectors, and foster innovative, leading businesses,\" according to a statement of the key meeting.\nThe government has rolled out an array of policies such as \"Made in China 2025\" and \"Internet Plus\" strategies to spur the integration of internet technologies and manufacturing, as well as other traditional sectors.\n\"After the process of digitization, businesses will see a 30-percent increase in production efficiency on average and a 20-percent drop in operational costs,\" the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said.\nWu Hequan, an academic with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said big data technology would redefine a series of sectors including finance, medical care, manufacturing, logistics and transportation, and prompt automobile, education and tourism to form new business models.\nThe food delivery unit of Meituan Dianping, China's largest group deals site, hires around 500,000 couriers, 31 percent of whom come from declining traditional industries and 10 percent from poor areas.\n\"Our services create employment and value, and represent the future of the economy,\" said Wang Xing, chief executive of Meituan Dianping.\nRising innovators\nThe digital economy is backed by numerous homegrown Chinese tech firms developing from followers to leaders in the international tech community.\n\"China's three internet giants are building a rich digital ecosystem that is now spreading beyond them. Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent ... are driving technical performance such as computing efficiency to set new world-class standards,\" the MGI said.\nInvestment has also poured in. The MGI said China was among the world's top three destinations for venture capital in key types of digital technology, including autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, robotics, drones and AI.\nOne in three of the world's 262 unicorns (or startups valued at more than $1 billion) is Chinese, commanding 43 percent of the global value of these companies.\nThe government has promised tax breaks, financing support and other favorable policies to help innovative firms sprout and grow, and expects to see more domestic players able to take on international rivals.\n\"China is already a global digital economy, and it is going to have a greater impact on the global digital world,\" said Jonathan Woetzel, senior partner at McKinsey.\nXinhua\nVisitors interact with a robot on the opening day of the Xiaoshan Robot Expo Center in Zhejiang province on Dec 23.

The participants were a line of secretaries, human resource officers and marketing and public relations staff who knew nothing about the basics of coding and computer programming.\nThey were all employees of 4Paradigm, a three-year-old startup founded by Baidu Inc's former principal IT architect and backed by global venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital.\nThe company has been dubbed by investors the Chinese answer to the US big data firm Palantir.

Usually, models with 0.8 are good enough for industrial application.\n\"But that is not good enough because 30 percent of them failed. There is still a long way to go,\" Dai added.\nCurrently, the company has over 100 employees and Yang Qiang, the only Chinese councilor at the Association of the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, is its principal scientist.\nZhao Ziming, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys, said the ability to analyze data becomes increasingly important as companies realize that within the voluminous quantity of data lie insights that could give them a competitive edge.\n\"Without AI-enabled data science, there would be no personalized shopping recommendations on websites like eBay and Amazon and tailored content and advertising on Facebook,\" he added. \"But it is pretty difficult for companies to cash in onto such demand.\"\nIn a KPMG survey of senior executives, 99 percent said that analysis of big data was important to their strategy for next year.\nData scientists have become highly sought-after in the marketplace, but there are still relatively few of them.

[Photo\/Agencies]\nBEIJING -- Glib Chinese web users have raised a challenge to the AI program that recently dethroned one of the top human Go players, demanding tongue-in-cheek that the AlphaGo program learn the nation's real pastime - mahjong.\u00a0\nChina's reaction toward the historic duel between human and artificial intelligence has been mixed. At first, there were questions on why the human player did not come from China, where the game was invented more than 2,500 years ago.\nThen, as AlphaGo marked three victories in the five-game match, defiant web users began calling for a challenge in an arena average Chinese are more comfortable in.\n\"Can AI beat mahjong masters?\" was posted several times in the comment section of stories about the AlphaGo-Lee Sedol match on Chinese microblog Sina Weibo, where they attracted a deluge of comments defending humanity' glory in mahjong.\nMahjong, China's answer to poker, is usually played by four people. Each turn, players draw tiles from a 144-tile pool, discard or intercept others' to form sets of tiles that can win. Scientists say compared with Go, mahjong has far fewer permutations for AI calculation, but involves a degree of chance and other factors in favor of humans.\n\"Sometimes with a glimpse of the other player's facial expression, I know how he or she is going to play. Can AI do that?\" asked one blogger.\n\"Unlike Go, mahjong is not a quiet game that focuses on calculation. It involves a lot of interactions and teamwork between players,\" another blogger commented.\nSome netizens described mahjong as a competition on both IQ and EQ. Computers can undoubtedly blow humans out of water in math, but how about their ability of communication and interpreting emotions?\nSense and sensibility\nScientists have advised against exaggerating AI's prowess after the Go victory. In the gaming field alone, AI researchers agree that computers, in their current stage, may not be able to beat humans in games that feature a high level of irrationality, including understanding of feelings and creativity.\n\"AlphaGo's learning and calculation prowess is based on formulas and data, but mahjong involves luck and emotions. To my knowledge, no AI is powerful enough to manage them,\" said Ren Yi, an expert on computer game AI and CEO of a Nanjing-based tech company.\nFeng Jianfeng, chief scientist for a brain science and AI project launched by the city of Shanghai, also refused to bet on AI's definitive victory over human mahjong masters, as the game involves more human intelligence than calculation.\n\"AlphaGo's structure and arithmetic only emulates some primary functions of human brains, not including emotions, decision making, attention and creativity,\" Feng said. \"It has just done something computers are very good at. It is a landmark and will greatly boost AI development, but AI still has a long way to go.\"\nFeng's team is studying Alzheimer's disease with the help of AI, but defying public expectations of AI supplementing patients' declining brain abilities, Feng said what computers could do so far was helping make more accurate diagnoses by navigating through big data.\nThe disease affects tens of millions of elderly people worldwide and has no effective cure, though medical experts say playing games that activate brains could help with the prevention.\nSo for those worrying about the disease, the Chinese advice would be, instead of pinning hopes on AI, to sit with friends and enjoy a game of mahjong.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/85\/145801786433.jpg\nb8ac6f43d0631850e8f32b.jpg\n","372":"China has assembled 120 \u00adresearchers from the military to work for its top research institute as part of a push to develop \u00admilitary \u00adapplications for artificial \u00adintelligence and quantum technology, according to state media.\n\nThe military selected the \u00adresearchers from across armed forces' commands to join the \u00adChinese Academy of Military Science, the highest-level research institute of the People's Liberation Army, the PLA Daily reported.\n\u00a0\nMore than 95 per cent of the new recruits enlisted by the academy had PhD degrees and were highly specialised in certain fields, particularly artificial intelligence assisted unmanned vehicles and quantum technology, the report said.\n\nAnalysts said the recruitment was part of China's efforts to \u00adbecome a military technological superpower and to catch up with the technical superiority of US armed forces.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has launched a massive overhaul and modernisation of the country's military and he said in a speech given to the military science academy last July that China should aim at building world-class \u00admilitary technology institutes.\n\nCollin Koh, a military expert in the maritime security programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said: \"PLA quests in these tech fields are motivated by the US or the West in general.\n\n\"China has a long-term desire to be on a par with these leaders in military tech, both for national \u00addefence purposes and to position itself also as a global arms \u00adsupplier.\"\n\nHe added that China hoped breakthroughs in technology could counter US military dominance in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"China's quest into these military tech fields is also in line with its military strategy and posture, which looks at nullifying via asymmetrical means the general US military superiority in envisaged regional flashpoints such as the Taiwan Strait,\" Koh said.\n\nA group led by Pan Jianwei at the University of Science and Technology of China is one of the teams heading the country's \u00adresearch into quantum technology. The research can involve \u00addeveloping applications that take advantage of scientists' increasing understanding of how the world works at a subatomic level, through particles smaller than atoms and electrons.\n\nAnalysts believe China could gain a military advantage if it manages to apply any breakthroughs in quantum technology for use by its armed forces.\n\nBen Ho, a researcher in the military studies programme at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, said: \"One key benefit is that it enables the user to have better sensors and \u00adcon\u00adcomitantly, greater situational awareness.\n\n\"Information is king in the modern battle and the side with the better picture would have a clear edge over its opponent,\" Ho said.\n\nChina successfully launched the world's first satellite in August 2016 to test ways of using quantum technology to communicate from space.\n\nIt is also using quantum \u00adresearch to develop a new type of satellite that can track targets that are currently invisible from space, such as stealth bombers taking off at night.\n\nHo said quantum technology and computers could in the coming years also help crack the \u00adencrypted codes of adversaries.\n\n\"Quantum technology could be game changing and the successful integration of quantum technology with China's regular military forces could profoundly change the regional security balance, which is already moving towards Beijing's favour,\" Ho said.\n\n\"While the full promise of quantum technology has yet to be realised, China is doing it right to explore assiduously the potential of this technology.\"\n\nMilitary expert Koh also said the development of AI would \u00adreduce manpower needs in the armed forces and was a relatively low-cost and lower risk method to project China's military power in sometimes dangerous situations.\n\nChina sent a drone into disputed airspace near the Diaoyu Islands, which Japan calls the Senkaku Islands, in the East China Sea in 2013 and it was later intercepted by a Japanese fighter aircraft.\n\nBoth countries lay claim to the islands and the dispute has \u00adbecome a long-standing source of tension between the two sides.\n","373":" Chinese tech giant ZTE believes its home-grown electronic personal assistant will be more than a match for Apple's Siri, Google's Now, Microsoft's Cortana or Amazon's Echo. \n The smartphone maker is so confident of its voice-control and artificial intelligence technology that it is banking on grabbing a leading share of the global market.\n It also planned to aggressively rebrand its image through social media and marketing - an area other Chinese firms tended to neglect, said Lin Waiman, senior director of technology and partnership at ZTE.\u00a0\n\"We have put a lot of work into building a smart system based on voice control and artificial intelligence. It uses chips that we developed ourselves. It is a separate ecosystem in its own right,\" he said at the firm's Shenzhen headquarters.\n The idea of having an electronic genie as the centrepiece of a smartphone is hardly new. Apple introduced Siri - the best known electronic personal assistant - with its iPhone 4s in 2011. Voice-command features have since become a must-have for any top-market smartphone, with Google, Microsoft and Amazon putting forward their own candidates for the \"smartest electronic genie of them all\".\n After years of competing over hardware specifications such as screen resolution or camera pixels, major tech companies are betting on voice-activated interfaces to be the next big thing to sell \"smart\" gadgets.\nSpeaking to CNN last year, Adam Cheyer, the co-founder of Siri, said: \"There has been a series of battles to gain market share at the point where users interface with computers. I think the major companies have to get into this game or risk not having direct interaction with a user.\"\nLin believes it is essential to get the feature right from the start. \"Instead of upgrading our phones' specifications a tiny bit for every new launch, we believe true innovation lies in coming up with something original that stands out from others in the market,\" he said.\n Lin pictured how a busy taxi driver could simply talk to his phone whenever he needed help: the latest weather, traffic conditions or a customer's destination. \n ZTE recently launched its new flagship smartphone, the Star 2, with voice and motion-controlled features at its core. \nA long press on the \"home\" button wakes up the assistant, which responds to a variety of commands, but unlike other virtual assistants, does not have a name. Users can open apps, play music, toggle Wi-fi, activate the camera, and even swap between front and rear camera lenses using their voices. \n The system can unlock the phone using a pre-set command, and it recognises the owner's voice. Many overseas brands offer similar products. But in China, Star 2 costs only 2,499 yuan (HK$3,145). \n Lin claims his system is quicker and more accurate than other voice-control assistants, including Apple's Siri.\n A test of its functions by the                Post showed a system that consistently and accurately responded to various commands including \"take a selfie for me using low aperture\", spoken in Putonghua. When the phone is placed next to the owner's ear, the phone asks who it should call.             \nThe phone had been \"very popular\" with consumers in China and overseas, Lin said. Digitaltrends, a popular gadget review website, said ZTE's smart assistant was \"so good it makes Siri look silly\".\n ZTE has teamed up with an increasing number of software makers and other technology partners. For example, it has been working with US software firm Nuance Communications since last year to develop better voice-recognition technology. \n On the mainland, the world's largest smartphone market, ZTE is lagging behind domestic competitors such as Xiaomi and Huawei, both of which have made use of social media to market their products. Lin admitted this was an area that ZTE had neglected, but he said the company had launched a department specifically to expand its fan base.\n ZTE's rebranding exercise is part of a broader trend among Chinese smartphone makers that are expanding overseas and challenging market leaders Samsung and Apple.\n It plans to drastically increase the number of brick-and-mortar shops on the mainland from 30,000 to between 60,000 and 100,000, to reassure users that there are places that can deal with their problems.\n The company is trying to win over consumers abroad by boosting its marketing budget by half to over 10 billion yuan. In the US, in particular, its marketing budget will triple. \"If we can make it in the US, we can make it anywhere in the world,\" Lin said. \nZTE shipped about 100 million mobile devices globally last year, including 48 million smartphones. Smartphones contributed 70 per cent of the total revenue of its mobile devices business.\nIn the US, ZTE was the fourth-largest smartphone vendor in the third quarter with a market share of 6.3 per cent, behind Apple, Samsung and LG.  But to gain brand recognition, ZTE must shake off its image as a maker of budget-priced phones. Last year it stopped selling smartphones under 600 yuan, Lin said.\nWe have put a lot of work into building a smart system based on voice control\nLin Waiman, ZTE\n","374":"Opening ceremony\nTime: 9 am to 11:30 am, Oct 12 Venue: On-site Conference Area of Hall 1\n2017 seventh China Intelligence Industry Summit and keynote speeches\nTime: 9 am to noon, Oct 12\nVenue: Conference Center Meeting Room 201+202(Meeting Room B+C)\u00a0\n2017 National Robot And Artificial Intelligence Competition\nTime: 11 am to 5 pm, Oct 12\nVenue: Hall 5\n2017 seventh China Intelligence Industry Summit and high-level dialogues\nTime: 1 pm to 2:30 pm, Oct 12\nVenue: Conference Center Meeting Room 201+202(Meeting Room B+C)\nSmart Manufacturing + Green Supply Chain Innovation Forum\nTime: 1:30 pm to 5 pm, Oct 12\nVenue: Conference Center Meeting Room 203\nInternet Plus Strategy to Boost the Transforming and Upgrading of the Manufacturing Industry\nTime: 2 pm to 4:30 pm, Oct 12\nVenue: On-site Conference Area of Hall 1\nCompany Recommendations\nTime: 2 pm to 3:30 pm, Oct 12\nVenue: On-site Conference Area of Hall 2\nInternet Strategy to Boost the Transforming and Upgrading of Foshan's Economy\nTime: 2 pm to 5 pm, Oct 12\nVenue: On-site Conference Area of Hall 4\nThe Most Beautiful Realm, the Best Future (a promotion from the visual reality sector)\nTime: 4:40 pm to 4:50 pm, Oct 12\nVenue: On-site Conference Area of Hall 2\n2017 Intelligent Robot Symposium\nTime: 9 am to 12:20 pm Oct 13\nVenue: Conference Center Meeting Room 201 (Meeting Room B)\n2017 National Robot And Artificial Intelligence Competition\nTime: 9 am to 5 pm, Oct 13\nVenue: Hall 5\n2017 Youth Innovation Summit on Artificial Intelligence\nTime: 9 am to 12:20 pm, Oct 13\nVenue: Conference Center Meeting Room 202 (Meeting Room C)\n2017 Forum on Intelligent Transportation Systems\nTime: 9:20 am to 11:45 am, Oct 13\nVenue: Hilton Foshan 5F Lingnan Room\n\"Internet Plus Intelligent Manufacturing in China\" Summit Forum -

[Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]\nThree Chinese internet companies have rolled out a global artificial intelligence (AI) contest with what claims to be among the largest open datasets, enabling talents a data-rich environment to hone their research.\nChina's second-biggest search giant Sougou, Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital founded by former Google and Microsoft executive Lee Kai-fu, and internet firm ByteDance launched the \"AI Challenger\" in Beijing on Monday.\nThe three plan to invest tens of millions of yuan in the coming three years on the platform and invite more companies to expand open data and bring down research barriers.\n\"In the US, professors and researchers would complain falling behind big corps due to the lack of data. Here we hope to set up a longstanding contest and cultivate talents by providing them huge data pool,\" Wang Xiaochuan, CEO of Sougou, said.\nStarting from next month, AI Challenger vows to release over 300,000 image-based as well as over 10 million text-based data entries to participants, of which research results can be applied to fields such as autonomous driving, human-computer interaction, image understanding, robotic vision and machine translation, according to the organizers.\n\"Compared to seven years ago when the cost of starting an internet-related business was record low, such cost under the age of AI is high,\" said Lee Kai-fu, adding that AI research should go beyond borders.\nThe launch of the platform comes one month after China released its national AI development plan. Under the roadmap, the country aims to grow the industry to 1 trillion yuan and become a global leader in AI by 2030.\n\"Chinese firms are striving to become major contributors to the advance of AI technology,\" Wang said.\nAI Challenger competition opens through Dec 3, and winners will receive a total of 2 million yuan awards.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/29\/150278185324.jpg\neca86bd9e2e01afcd57a02.jpg\n","376":"Artificial\u00a0intelligence is poised to take on humans in the game of Texas Hold 'em poker, after having aced people in the games of chess and go, as technology companies race to set the next milestone in the epic contest between machines and humanity.\n\u00a0\nA computer program called Libratus, developed by the Carnegie Mellon University, will challenge a six-strong team of China's top poker players in 36,000 hands of the game over five days in Hainan.\n\nThe winner of the contest, starting today, will walk away with bragging rights and two million yuan (HK$2.26 million) in prize money.\n\nLee Kai-fu, the former greater China president of Google and founder of the venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures, gives humans at most a 10 per cent chance of beating Libratus.\n\n\"Even if the human team is lucky enough to win this time, the computer will still be able to beat all human players within a year because machines can keep training themselves at a much faster speed to make progress and to succeed,\" said Lee, whose Sinovation is one of the organisers of the showdown in Hainan.\n\nWhat is at stake is more than bragging rights. Artificial\u00a0intelligence is now at the centre of myriad real world applications, from facial recognition software and cybersecurity to more futuristic technologies like autonomous self-driving vehicles.\n\nChinese technology companies have also been piling into artificial intelligence. Baidu, operator of the mainland's dominant internet search engine, has 1,300 staff in its AI division. It entered its Xiaodu bot in a popular television game show in China called Super Brain, in which it won against human contestants.\n\nTencent Holdings, operator of the mainland's largest social media network, has 50 AI scientists working in areas involved in machine learning, computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n\nAlibaba Group Holdings, owner of the South China Morning Post, has an AI program that helps identify counterfeit products sold on the world's largest online shopping platforms.\n\nAfter IBM's DeepBlue vanquished world chess grand champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo program set the next milestone with its 4-1 victory in March 2016 over go master Lee Sedol.\n\nThe game of go, popular in China, Japan and South Korea, is considered much harder for computers to win than chess, because it requires the program to engage a deep learning method called artificial neural network to learn its moves.\n\nStill, with chess and go, the players can see the entire board. In poker, players do not get to see each other's hands. So Libratus is not only equipped with computing power, but also with an enhanced algorithmic approach to the game, particularly the way it deals with imperfect or hidden information.\n\nLibratus has already beaten four of the world's best poker players - Dong Kim, Jason Les, Jimmy Chou and Daniel McAulay - in a 20-day tournament in Pittsburgh in January. The competition in Hainan will be the program's first against humans in Asia.\n\n\"Despite a rare odds, we still have a chance to win,\" said Du Yue, head of Team Dragon, which will be facing down Libratus. \"Three in our team, including myself, majored in computer science in Tsinghua University. We have been discussing strategies in the past several days to prepare for the game.\"\n\nDu won the 2016 World Series of Poker, a major global tournament for the game.\n\nThe next milestone in AI may pave the way for solutions to replace humans in various jobs like driving, to financial analysis. This week, Hong Kong's Yunfeng Financial Group, owned by Alibaba, is poised to launch a Robo-Advisor to help customers allocate their global assets.\n\nComputer programs like AlphaGo have demonstrated that they are capable of high intelligence quotient (IQ) in their victories over humans, but \"it requires high emotional quotient (EQ) to beat humans in poker\", Lee said.\n\nThe development of artificial intelligence has come to a tipping point, said Lee, who worked at Microsoft Corp and Apple before he headed Google's greater China business from 2005 to 2009.\n\n\"AI will beat humans in a lot of areas, as long as it is fed with massive amounts of labelled data,\" he said. \"It's time for AI experts to wave goodbye to universities and say hello to entrepreneurship. We can provide them with data and money if they want to set up their businesses.\"\n","377":"A participant pays for the taxi fare via WeChat during a press conference for WeChat Pay Hong Kong in Hong Kong on Oct 31, 2017. (ROY LIU \/ CHINA DAILY)\u00a0\nDigital transformation will contribute $9 billion to Hong Kong's GDP in the next four years, supported by artificial intelligence, according to a study released by Microsoft and research firm IDC on Friday.\nThe study predicted the pace of digital transformation across Asia Pacific's economies would accelerate.\nLast year, about 5 percent of local GDP was derived from digital technology-related products and services such as mobility, cloud and artificial intelligence. This proportion is expected to rise to about 60 percent by 2022.\nIDC forecasted that 40 percent of transformation would be supported by AI and cognitive capabilities by 2019\n\"In fact, organizations are seeing tangible improvements from their digital transformation initiatives today between the ranges of 17 to 24 percent,\" said Ralph Haupter, president of Microsoft Asia.\n\"This shows that digital transformation is no longer an idea, but a reality,\" he added.\nThe study mentioned 80 percent of Hong Kong organizations are in the progress of digital transformation, while IDC forecasted 40 percent of transformation would be supported by AI and cognitive capabilities by 2019.\nDigital wallet operator TNG is now using Microsoft Azure as a cloud computing platform to provide innovative solutions for customers.\n\"We partner with Microsoft to deploy secured financial services, as we are moving billions of dollars every month within our e-Wallet, not just in Hong Kong but also across 14 countries,\" said TNG's CEO and founder Alex Kong.\nKong said the e-Wallet applied AI Chatbot recently, offering assistance to users. It helps solve the startup's shortage of staff as well as helping TNG understand users' problems and how to address them.\nAs digital transformation takes off, 79 percent of jobs in Hong Kong will be transformed in the next three years, predicts Cally Chan, general manager at Microsoft Hong Kong.\nBut she is not worried about job losses. The study found 23 percent of new jobs are expected to be created from digital transformation, more than the numberof jobs to be automated (19 percent).\nShe suggested people should prepare for this, as digital transformation will impact on every sector.\n\"People should equip themselves with a right mindset that they can get it if they are striving to learn new things,\" Chan added.\nThe most in-demand skills in Hong Kong currently are big data, software and user testing, as well as mobile development.\nedithlu@chinadailyhk.com\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/20\/152423317029.jpg\n\n","378":"China's courts are embracing new technology and artificial intelligence in a bid to speed up judicial procedures and ensure that verdicts are more accurate and equitable.\nRobots and online databases are increasingly being used to bolster the judicial system, as Cao Yin reports.\nChina's courts are embracing new technology and artificial intelligence in a bid to speed up judicial procedures and ensure that verdicts are more accurate and equitable.\nLast month, the lawsuit center at Beijing No 1 Intermediate People's Court attracted widespread attention when a robot called Xiao Fa was put into operation.\nMembers of the public and court officials can ask the robot questions verbally and obtain a spoken reply, and also make queries via a regular computer keyboard or by writing Chinese characters on its screen on it's front, and receive a printout.\u00a0\n\"Xiao Fa attracts a lot of attention, partly as a result of its appearance, but mainly because it can provide essential details, such as how to bring a lawsuit, and also retrieve case histories, verdicts and laws. It reduces our workload and improves the efficiency of our services,\" said Zhao Lan, head of the lawsuit center.\nThe robot, which has a vaguely humanoid appearance and boasts speech circuits, was designed by Aegis, a technology company in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. It first came to public attention in July, after undergoing six months of tests.\nIt is being used at more than 100 courts nationwide, but its use is expected to become more widespread rapidly. However, at a cost of 50,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan ($7,528 to $22,585), depending on size, Xiao Fa isn't cheap.\nAegis just one of a number of businesses in the internet and technology sectors applying AI to the legal sector. For example, Wu Song Network Technology Co unveiled Fa Xiaotao, a robotic research assistant, in October last year. Unlike Xiao Fa, it is rarely used in courts.\nDu Xiangyang, CEO and founder of Aegis, stressed the differences between the robot assistants.\n\"Fa Xiaotao mainly serves law firms and company lawyers, while Xiao Fa is used by litigants, judges and court officials. We want our robot to help solve disputes in a way that people find easy to understand,\" he said.\nLegal assistance\nWhen people are investigating their legal rights or considering bringing a lawsuit, some consult lawyers, while others look for answers on the internet, but neither method is perfect, according to Du.\n\"Most answers provided by search engines are based on other people's experiences, and are not professional opinions, while consulting a lawyer costs a lot of money,\" said the 37-year-old, who majored in business management.\nXiao Fa is designed to solve both problems because its database contains authorized judgments and its services are free.\nIn addition to using Aegis' robots in court centers, the public can also search for information via the company's WeChat account, which was established in July.\n\"It's a cloud computing platform which is aimed at providing more convenient legal services for users,\" Du said.\nFor example, if someone sustains injuries in a traffic accident, the platform can provide information about procedures, such as how to contact the police and request to see relevant footage captured by surveillance cameras.\n\"The public has given a warmer welcome to our WeChat platform than to our robots because the online platform can provide information at any time,\" Du said, adding that the system is linked to more than 350 judicial authorities, including courts and justice bureaus.\nCompany statistics show that the platform receives more than 30,000 requests every day, and can provide immediate answers for 85 percent of the questions.\nBoth Xiao Fa and the WeChat platform have access to a database that is constantly updated and contains details of more than 40,000 legal procedures, and answers to about 30,000 frequently asked legal questions. It also holds information about more than 7,000 laws and 5 million cases.\n\"We build a computer algorithm to seek answers in the database in line with the questions, but we only provide possible solutions, not model answers,\" Du said.\nHe compared Xiao Fa with court officials who assist both judges and litigants.\n\"It helps litigants to understand their disputes, while its responses to legal queries can provide judges with more time to work on complicated cases,\" he said.\nA 'smart' friend\nJiang Youyi, CEO of Wu Song, said Fa Xiaotao is programmed to select attorneys from a database of more than 60,000 lawyers who have experience in various fields. So, if a company has a problem related to contract law, the robot can provide details of lawyers for hire who have acted in similar cases.\nWu Song plans to focus the robot on providing companies with advice in a range of legal fields.\nSo far, it has provided services for about 10,000 companies, and its database contains details of more than 43 million verdicts, he said.\nRelevant information\nBy contrast, Xiao Fa is designed to provide advice to individuals, according to Du: \"Its algorithm is designed to reflect the most-frequently-asked questions in specific regions to ensure the answers it provides are relevant and accurate.\"\nFor example, the Xiao Fa robot in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, which is home to a large number of migrant workers, is programmed to provide employees with information about labor-related disputes, while the robots used in Beijing's courts focus mainly on civil and commercial law, he said.\n\"As a friend of the public, the robot must understand their problems and suit its searches to their cases,\" he said. \"We're also studying how laws can be explained more easily, because regular people rarely understand concepts when the language is too complex or legalistic.\"\nDu, a native of Jinhua, Zhejiang province, started Aegis shortly after graduating from Nanjing University in 2006, despite having no experience of either computing or the law.\nFirst, he used big data to analyze public responses to judgments made by a court in Nanjing. \"At the time, I was interested in the combination of the internet and laws, realizing it would be significant in both fields,\" he said.\nIn the past decade, he has witnessed the growing influence of technology in the legal sector, and his original team of three has grown into a company with more than 120 employees.\nAlthough he believes that AI's time in the legal spotlight has definitely arrived, he dismissed the notion that robots will eventually replace lawyers.\n\"The goal of providing justice by upgrading technologies does not mean lawyers will disappear. However, attorney's assistants may be replaced because robots can easily search for case materials and locate specific laws. I believe AI will bring many more changes,\" he said.\n\"I suggest that people consult a lawyer for all complicated disputes, such as criminal cases, because they are affected by many things, such as emotions, which robots cannot understand.\"\nFuture challenges\nMost people engaged in the AI sector are age 30 or younger. \"Their innovative attitude and passion push forward technological change in the sector,\" Du said.\nHe noted that the average age of his employees is 28, and he employs twice as many technicians than people who to collate lists of laws and legal definitions.\nHe Weican, 22, a law graduate from Guangdong University of Finance, said his job is a little like \"fighting monsters. New problems are always emerging in the AI industry. What we do is figure them out and combat them by updating the technology. It's fascinating.\"\nFor Wang Yizhen, a technician with Aegis, the challenge is the most rewarding aspect of his job.\n\"Explaining difficult laws through specific computer algorithms is a real challenge for me, but if I can solve the problems more people will benefit,\" the 25-year-old said.\nHe added that no one can predict how the growth of AI will change the world, but he and his colleagues are determined to play their part.\n\"Using technology and the law to help others will remain our long-term goal,\" he said.\nContact the writer at caoyin@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 11\/16\/2017 page6)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/82\/151079330370.jpg\n00221917e13e1b771e0920.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/77\/151079330603.jpg\n00221917e13e1b771e1121.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/12\/151079330869.jpg\n00221917e13e1b771e1522.jpg\n","379":"The 4th China Robot Summit kicked off on Tuesday, features artificial intelligence technologies and service robots.\nA man looks at an automatic trashcan at the 4th China Robot Summit in Yuyao, East China's Zhejiang province, May 16, 2017.

The people, in this case China's online community, have plenty of suggestions.\u00a0\nImagine using the AI technology to invent a poker machine complete with a computer vision gear allowing it to recognize human motions and gestures. Contests would be more humane rather than a cold-hearted game of computing prowess, a Web user said after watching the competition.\nOthers want to see Google's DeepMind team come up with AlphaMahjong to take on China's most popular four-handed pastime which features slippery concepts like teamwork and cooperation\n\"The response of these fans are a good reminder that research must meet a realistic demand. I think many people want to take on AI machines as their favorite pastimes via their phones or laptops,\" said Xu Li, CEO of SenseTime, a Chinese AI company which specializes in computer vision.\nThat kind of interaction is currently restrained by the hardware. Such superior AI technology is still impossible to run on home computers or the smartest of phones, but that is sure to change.\nBy challenging one of the world's top Go players, AlphaGo has propelled itself to the high ground of AI research and development. AI may still be out of reach for most of us, but now it is at least in sight.\nThe rules of Go are incredibly simple, which leads to very complex strategic possibilities. In preparation for the match, AlphaGo was said to have played more than 30 million matches against itself and invented its own strategy through the mass of data generated. Every game it plays adds to its experience and makes it better.\n\"Without challenging the best players in the world, AI could never develop so quickly, but we must remember that technology is not to build a castle in the clouds but to improve people's lives.

In the third stage, the AI platform will be leveraged to offer ticketing and vendor services.\n\"Capitalizing on AI can help the audience-building process, while WKCD visitors can get great experience from appreciating the cultural activities to be held there in future,\" said WKCDA Chief Technology Officer Emily Chan Fung-ying.\nThe WKCDA has rolled out a five-year plan to transform the cultural park's infrastructures to be more scalable and flexible. For example, the company has formulated a location-based strategy to extend the number of Wi-Fi hotspots as much as possible. The private cloud of the data center located within Xiqu Centre, which is scheduled to open next year, will be connected to public cloud in due course to facilitate the management of videos and art print collections digitally.\n\"By applying AI technology, the system can gather all customer information, and we can also generate the information that visitors need to get them to visit the park again,\" Chan said.\nBesides the technology, the WKCD has introduced a completely autonomous vehicle that will be tested at its Nursery Park in the coming months. The French-made, 100-percent self-driving and environment-friendly car is equipped with sensors and different technologies to allow for efficient mobility propelled by full 3D vision within the cultural park. The WKCDA will determine how many such cars should be ordered, based on market demand.\nThe cultural park operator said, however, there's no plan to deploy robotics at this moment, adding that the matter will be looked into when the need arises.\nThe WKCDA is not alone as more local enterprises begin leveraging AI to maximize business performance.\nJardine Restaurant Group's Pizza Hut launched its digital marketing strategy as far back as 2006 by adopting the marketing cloud that integrates ordering systems, in-store point of sales, customer segmentation and big data analytics.\nWith the marketing cloud in play, Pizza Hut has eliminated paper-based coupons and switched 200,000 customers from membership cards to its loyalty app with its current loyalty membership standing at 420,000.\nThe Pizza Hut app utilizing marketing cloud now supports triggers, such as new offers, alerts and coupons, in response to events like membership sign-up, pizza orders, points sharing and interactions online. Looking ahead, the restaurant will add new promotions for its existing marketing cloud, including a gold membership journey and birthday promotions. Lucky draw coupons and online promotions are also on the menu.\nThe Pizza Hut loyalty app has been downloaded by 350,000 customers since its introduction in mid-2015, helping to boost sales by 28 percent.\n\"Today's customers are technology-driven and respond well to new offerings and promotions,\" said Ravel Lai, information technology director for Pizza Hut, PHD and KFC franchises in Asia at Jardine Restaurant Group.\n\"We know so much more than we did before. It's really exciting for us to link customer data and mobile apps, and to understand the connection between customers and purchase triggers.\"\nShopline - the online shop for small and medium enterprises - also adopts sales cloud to process more leads without increasing head count or compromising services. Using sales cloud, Shopline has a comprehensive view of customer interactions across all integrated apps in all locations.\nBecause these leads come from a range of sources, including digital marketing, content marketing and a hotline, the system also helps to evaluate different methods of customer acquisition and monitor team performance.\nThe AI analytics tool further enables Shopline to evaluate lead sources and the sales team's closing rates. The technology allows the company to drive more targeted leads and help decide where to invest resources in growing channels or conducting campaigns.\n\"Understanding the customer contributes greatly to helping them succeed, thus facilitating Asian merchants in pursuing their localization strategy to build an e-commerce business in their respective markets\", Shopline Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Fiona Lau said.\nAI is a branch of computer science that deals with the simulation of human behaviors in computers to provide a range of customer services. The technology is increasingly being adopted in the whole value chain of economic activities.\nAccording to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), such technology is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, pushing the global gross domestic product (GDP) 14 percent higher during the same period.\nPwC envisioned that the greatest economic gains from AI will be seen on the Chinese mainland (with a 26-percent GDP boost in 2030) and North America (14.5 percent up), while Europe and developed Asian countries will see 9 to 12-percent GDP growth by AI adoption.\nThe biggest absolute gains will be in the retail, financial services and healthcare sectors, as AI raises productivity, product value and consumption, PwC said, adding that image-based diagnostics, on-demand production and autonomous traffic control will enjoy the greatest growth potential.\nAnother survey by India-based Tata Consultancy Services in September revealed that 80 percent of business executives from 835 companies across 13 global industry sectors said they're already investing in AI, and almost 100 percent will do so by 2020. By using the technology, these businesses can enhance revenues by an average of 17 percent and reduce costs by an average of 12 percent.\nAccording to the survey, the increases are the most dramatic among industries with the lowest current investment levels, including the travel, transport and hospitality sectors, followed by the media, entertainment and information services, industrial manufacturing, healthcare, and banking and finance.\nIn Hong Kong, AI will most likely be applied in areas like customer relationship management (CRM), financial services such as loan analysis, medical services and retail services, industry pundits anticipate.\nHowever, Hong Kong companies are still lukewarm to adopting the technology at this stage.\nOnly 63 percent of the surveyed Hong Kong enterprises are willing to adopt an AI-powered CRM platform - the least ratio recorded among eight Asia-Pacific countries and regions, according to CRM service provider Salesforce, which interviewed 707 companies in that region late last year.\n\"Costs, access to right market skills and the ability to keep the rate of changes are the three essential factors restricting Hong Kong companies in embracing the AI technology further,\" said Salesforce Regional Vice-President Robert Wickham.\nNonetheless, he's optimistic that Hong Kong businesses will be more receptive to the technology because it will become a basic necessity, just like electricity that any company must have to survive.\n\"The rise of globalization is unleashing market forces propelling the widespread AI adoption that will render intelligent assistance to employees and strengthen their productivity,\" Wickham envisaged.\nAccording to a report by global advisory firm Accenture, AI application would raise productivity worldwide by up to 40 percent in 2035.\noswald@chinadailyhk.com\n(HK Edition 10\/27\/2017 page8)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/88\/150905787493.jpg\n00221917e13e1b5ca52d01.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/83\/150905787549.jpg\n00221917e13e1b5ca53502.jpg\n","404":"It is not a new debate whether robots are going to replace humans in certain jobs.

Lagou.com, a job seeking website for employees in the Internet industry, launched in the innovation street in July 2013.\nThe website received an angel investment of more than 1 million yuan from noted investors including Xu Xiaoping and Zeng Liqing shortly after it came into operation. Four months later, the website received about 1,000 resumes every day. Lagou.com has a public account on social media platform WeChat and applicants can track their resumes via the account. They can see if their resumes have been sent to employers, whether the employers have looked at their resumes and if they will be offered an interview.\nHuman resources personnel working at Internet companies can access new resumes via the WeChat account.\nThe website also provides job seekers with micro blog accounts of employers whose companies are not known to them to help them find out about more opportunities.\nStatistics from the website showed that by October 2014 its number of registered users hit 1 million and 3 million resumes had been sent to the platform. The website serves more than 20,000 Internet companies including Baidu, Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alibaba Holdings Ltd.\nThe Internet companies cover 25 fields including mobile Internet, e-commerce, online games, big data, cloud computing, social networking, Internet finance, online education and online travel services.\nLagou.com received an investment of $5 million in March 2014 and another $25 million in August.\nLast week, the website held a recruitment event in the innovation street where 50 Internet companies offered 1,000 jobs and more than 3,000 job seekers joined in. Traditional organizations including Haier, a home appliances maker, and Hunan TV station, one of the most popular TV program providers in China, also took part in the event.\nDifferent service organizations in the innovation street formed a complete service chain for startups. People preparing to set up a startup frequent Garage Cafe and 3W Coffee.com, while startups like to visit 36 Kr, which provides companies with free office facilities for three months. Small and medium-sized businesses prefer other organizations including the AAMA Club, which helps its members raise finance.\nThe service organizations also host events for startup owners and those preparing to found companies. Binggo Cafe holds an event called \"Friday Cafe\" every week where one entrepreneur is invited to share their experience of setting up a company.\nGarage Cafe usually asks entrepreneurs who work there to share their ideas and products with other customers at noon every day to help find investors and partners. 3W Coffee.com holds events with the theme of Internet knowledge where leading businessmen from all walks of life share their experience of micro blog marketing, e-commerce, mobile Internet and Internet investment. The innovation street also cooperates with financial organizations and became a pilot area for institutions to offer startups and small enterprises financial services.When the street opened the administrative committee of Zhongguancun Haidian Science Park and the Zhongguancun branch of Bank of Beijing signed an agreement.\nThe two agreed to cooperate on long-term exclusive financial services, financing recommendation for startups and small enterprises and credit systems for small and medium-sized businesses.\nContact the writer at songmengxing@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 03\/28\/2015 page10)\n","409":"As artificial intelligence is no longer a wild figment of the imagination or the stuff of science fiction, research into AI is becoming increasingly appealing to scientists.\nFor Zheng Nanning, director of the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Xi'an Jiaotong University, AI is the study of how to make machines \"think\" and act like human beings.\nOne of the primary frontiers of research in the field is how to develop AI that is able to process non-complete information, said Zheng, who is also an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering.\u00a0\n\"'Robustness' refers to the AI's adaptability to users' errors, target deviation, error model and even non-modeling objects,\" he said.\nZheng, also a former president of Xi'an Jiaotong University from 2003 to 2014, started to establish the AI discipline in the school in 1985 after completing his studies in Japan.\n\"I went to Japan in 1981, when there was an upsurge in the development of artificial intelligence,\" Zheng recalled. \"I was impressed by the progress in computer science and its widespread use in social life in the country.\"\nAfter he returned to his homeland in 1985, China decided to develop AI technology as a priority in its seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90). Zheng and Xuan Guorong, the first director of the institute, co-founded the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in 1986.\nAs the central government prioritized the development of information and computer science, Zheng's institute has embraced many opportunities for growth over the past 30 years - cognitive computing and computer vision.\nIn AI development, one of the major challenges facing scientists is how to enable machines to learn without help from human teachers, Zheng said. \"Much of human learning is a logical reasoning process of mastering something new based on their previous knowledge,\" he said. \"In contrast, no current AI systems have such an ability.\"\nEvery time an AI machine learns a new skill, it basically has to learn from the very beginning, which requires the participation of human beings to a large extent, he explained.\n\"To achieve human intelligence, the machine needs to have the ability to learn without human supervision and instruction, using previous knowledge to make richer inferences from a very small amount of training data.\"\nAnother challenge is to make machines perceive and understand the world as humans do, the senior scientist said.\n\"Perception is a key part of intelligence,\" he said. \"If machines can be made to perceive and understand the world as humans do, it will prove that the chronic problems of planning and reasoning in AI research can be solved.\"\n\"While we are good at data collection and algorithm research and development, and it is no longer an obstacle in AI development to use machines to analyze collected data, such reasoning capabilities are relied on data, which indicates that there's still a long way to go before AI can perceive the real world,\" Zheng said.\nIt is a tough task to make machines understand and depict natural behavior, he noted.\nAlphaGo, a Google-developed AI system, defeated Lee Se-dol, a South Korean professional Go player, in a series of games that hit headlines worldwide in March.\nIt is difficult to anticipate the most advantageous positions to move in the complicated Go games, yet it is much easier than capturing an accurate depiction of the sophisticated world, Zheng said\/t will take decades or even longer to close the gap of such understanding between machines and human beings.\"\nThe toughest challenge in realizing human-like intelligence is to enable machines to have self-awareness, emotions and the ability to reflect on their own situation and behaviors, Zheng said.\nBut human beings also stand to benefit from development of AI technology. \"Human cerebral cortex capacity is limited in physics,\" he said. \"If intelligent machines can be linked to human brains, it will not only enhance human capacity, but also allow machines to be inspired.\"\nIt is a fascinating exploration into seeking self-awareness, emotions and reflective ability in machines, to scientists and philosophers alike, Zheng said.\nHowever, AI research can be a \"double-edged sword\", he noted.\n\"We need to ensure that increasingly powerful AI systems remain completely under human control and watch out for AI's negative impact on human society and pay attention to the profound ethical issues brought up by its development,\" he said. \"We need the AI that helps human beings rather than taking their place.\"\nContact the writers through malie@chinadaily.com.cn\nA team from the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Xi'an Jiaotong University participates in an intelligent vehicle contest in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.

I didn't expect that he would make headlines last week by joining Beijing-based search engine Baidu Inc as its group president and chief operations officer. Well, at least not that soon.\nA widely respected engineer and technology leader, Lu is among a rare few Chinese talents who once held vital positions in an American tech company. He played a key role in pushing Microsoft into new areas, including artificial intelligence (AI).\u00a0\n\"I have a problem with the name of our slogan,\" Lu said during our business meeting six years ago, teasing that the name \"Bing\" in Chinese implies \"sickness or insanity\". \"Our Chinese clients might not feel comfortable with (the slogan) 'Have you Bing?'\"\nIn September, Lu left Microsoft \"to focus all his time on recovering from health conditions caused by a prior injury\", according to an email from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in response to public inquiries about a bicycle accident Lu had.\nNow, Lu needn't worry about the localization of Bing, the launch of Microsoft products or even office politics. He is embarking on a new journey at Baidu, where he will oversee products, technology, sales, marketing and operations.\nIn a statement released last week, Baidu's Chairman and Group CEO Robin Li called Lu \"the best global talent\". Lu possesses a wealth of leadership and management experience and is a leading authority in the area of artificial intelligence, said Li, adding, \"I am confident that Dr. Lu will make major contributions to the overall strength of our management and technology.\"\nAccording to Li, artificial intelligence is Baidu's key strategic focus for the next decade, and he is confident that with Li on board, \"our strategy will be executed smoothly, and Baidu will become a world-class technology company and global leader in AI\".\nRajesh Jha succeeded Lu as leader of the Office group, and the company simultaneously created a new 5,000-person AI and Research Group, led by Harry Shum.\nThe year of 2016 probably was Robin Li's most trying time in business, as the company he founded 16 years ago had undergone a severe credibility crisis.\nIn May, government regulators ordered Baidu to strictly limit advertising per page and clean up its medical-related paid-search business. The action followed public outrage over the death of a 21-year-old computer science student, Wei Zexi, who used Baidu to search for a cancer treatment that turned out to be a hoax.\nAs a result, Baidu in June lowered its second-quarter earnings guidance by 10 to 12 percent after more than half of its medical customers temporarily cut or delayed spending on its platform. A significant portion of Baidu's revenue was sacrificed under the adjustment.\nIn an internal memo, Li rallied Baidu staff to help change the company's culture and do the right thing.\n\"The management and employees' obsession with KPI (key performance index) has twisted our values ... and distanced ourselves from users,\" Li said. \"If we lose the support of users, we lose hold of our values, and Baidu will truly go bankrupt in just 30 days.\"\nLi assured that Baidu has taken steps \"to further bolster a healthy, safe and trustworthy online and offline ecosystem. The challenges Baidu faced in the second quarter served as a healthy reminder to stay focused on the key drivers of growth, sustainability and leadership: delivering the best user experience and staying at the forefront of technology.\"\nLu's appointment also suggested that Chinese technology giants are becoming increasingly lucrative destinations for top-notch talents who have international backgrounds and know well both the Eastern and Western business cultures.\nChinese Americans now are in a golden era of going east, said Tom Zhang, a Silicon Valley-based human resources specialist who also is the founder of an AI-related startup.\n\"In China, opportunities are much more plentiful than those in the US. I would suggest talents of Chinese background return to China to find your fortune,\" he said through his social media platform.\nContact the writer at junechang@chinadailyusa.com\n","411":"Unfazed by the early initiatives of Google and Tesla, Chinese online search giant Baidu is looking to take the lead in the commercial application of artificial intelligence for autonomous driving on the mainland, the world's largest car market.\n\"China's road conditions are, perhaps, much more complex than in other developed countries,\" Baidu chief financial officer Jennifer Li Xinzhe said at a Bloomberg event in Hong Kong on Wednesday.\u00a0\n\"Autonomous driving can bring tremendous value in the issues it can address [in China] like traffic jams, air pollution and road safety.\"\nLi reiterated Baidu's target of initially getting self-driving cars on mainland roads by 2018 and the mass production of these vehicles in 2020.\n\"We think the automobile is the next major computing platform,\" said Li. She added that the company has been investing in artificial intelligence over the past four or five years, with an eye on creating a new growth engine that will help transform traditional industries like transport and financial services.\n\"We think about it as electricity. If you look at how electricity has transformed human society, that is how AI is going to transform industries,\" she said.\nJohn Choi, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, said Baidu's AI efforts would have \"immaterial revenue contribution to Baidu over the next three years, \"while research and development investments might weigh on operating margins\".\nThe commercial prospects for AI may seem largely unclear to the investor community, but that has not stopped Baidu from making bigger bets in terms of strategic investments and alliances.\nEarlier this month, Baidu launched a US$200 million venture capital unit to invest in AI projects.\nBaidu Venture, which is headed by company founder and chief executive Robin Li Yanhong, will also focus on augmented and virtual reality initiatives.\nAI is our opportunity and we're pretty fortunate the world is coming to this stage\nJennifer Li Xinzhe, Baidu\nThis new enterprise will be independently run from Baidu's existing investment teams, allowing it to make fast decisions without having to go through complicated internal approval processes, the company said.\n\"AI is our opportunity and we're pretty fortunate the world is coming to this stage,\" Li said on the sidelines of the company's annual world conference in Beijing on September 1.\nHe pointed out that Baidu was about two to three years ahead of other companies in China in terms of AI development.\nAt the same event, Baidu and US semiconductor technology company Nvidia announced their partnership to develop autonomous driving based on Baidu's mapping data, image\nrecognition technology and Nvidia's high-performance AI computing platforms.\nNvidia chief executive Huang Jen-hsun said the partnership's goal was \"to build the self-driving car architecture from end-to-end, from top-to-bottom\" for Chinese and global carmakers.\nBaidu last month joined the Ford Motor Co in investing a combined US$150 million in Velodyne LiDAR, a company based in California's Silicon Valley that produces sensors for self-driving cars.\nThat investment is expected to help Velodyne expand the design and production of solid-state hybrid light, detention and ranging sensor technology, known as LiDAR, that can be used in a range of applications including three-dimensional mobile mapping, 3D aerial mapping and security.\n\"Baidu is developing autonomous vehicles with the intention to increase passenger safety and reduce traffic congestion and pollution in China,\" said Wang Jing, a senior vice-president at the Chinese online search giant and the general manager of its autonomous driving unit.\nAs many as 33 companies are currently involved in the development of driver assistance systems and self-driving cars, including Apple, General Motors and Microsoft.\nCopyright (c) 2016.

Wall-E? Terminator? David or the Teddy Bear in Artificial Intelligence? Optimus Prime in Transformer movies, Baymax in Big Hero 6?\nIn many movies there are robots that can think and communicate in a human way. With strong personalities, they can be serious, nagging, naughty, humorous, crafty, intelligent, emotional and extremely useful.\u00a0\nIn real life, however, robotic science and technology has not reached that level. But that's not to say that engineers around the world haven't built some very awesome robots.\n1. Asimo by Honda\nAsimo looks like a modest, lovely child. It is 130 centimeters in height. Able to recognize faces and languages and supported by strong artificial intelligence system, Asimo can communicate with people smoothly. It can make decisions on its own. For example, after asking people what to drink, it will fetch the drinks automatically. If there is a person in its path, it will give way to people.\nIt can play soccer, walk, run and jump on one foot.\nThe sensors on its fingers allow it to gauge the hardness of different objects the hands touch so that it can use different levels of strength to hold objects, either to open a tightly sealed water bottle or hold a paper cup of liquid.\n2. Curiosity Mars rover by NASA\nCuriosity seems lonely on Mars. After landing on the surface of the planet, it started itself automatically, turning its head 360 degrees to get a full view of the surroundings, sending the information to the satellite and back to Earth.\nWhen it sighted something unusual, Curiosity will locate the object and travel to the location. In NASA's video, Curiosity discovers a bare rock in the desert. It approached the rock and drilled into it to get a sample, and then it analyzed the sample and collected the data that was then sent to Earth.\n3. Wildcat and Big Dog by Boston Dynamics\nWildcat is amazing. It looks like a creepy headless steel cat skeleton. It can stand up from a prone position and gallop like a real cat. It can make turns while running.\nThe counterpart of Wildcat is Big Dog. It can adapt its walk in the wild, for example if it found itself in rocky terrain. Big Dogs can follow a leader on a mission.\n4. Kuratus by Suidobashi Heavy Industry\nKuratus is a 13-foot tall robot that can be ridden. It is similar to those big steel robots in Pacific Rim. You can control the robot in the cockpit in its chest. You can also control it using an iPhone.\nKuratus is made for fun. It can use a water bottle as its weapon, and its BB guns will be \"fired\" when the commander in the cockpit smiles.\n5. Termite Robots by Harvard University\nTermite Robots could replace human beings doing tough tedious building work. The way they work is inspired by termites. A swarm of centimeter-long termites can build a nest more than 40-feet tall. The long-term vision is that, in dangerous environments that are unsuitable for humans to work in, such as Mars, termite robots can work instead of humans, for example, when scientists want to build a space station.\n6. Atlas by Boston Dynamics\nAtlas is perhaps the most awesomely creepy humanoid rescue robot. It can walk upright on two legs, adapting its walks to different environments. The free upper limbs can lift and carry things.\nIn an extremely tough environment, Atlas can coordinate its feet and hands to climb, and make its way through congested spaces. Its agile hands can also use tools designed for humans.\n(China Daily 04\/25\/2015 page15)\n","415":"China, already the world's second-largest investor in artificial intelligence (AI), has set out an ambitious plan to leap frog ahead of the United States to be the global leader in the field by 2030.\u00a0\nThe proposal, laid out on July 8 by the State Council and distributed on July 20, takes a three-step approach: firstly keep pace with leading AI technology and applications in general by 2020, make major breakthroughs by 2025, and be the world leader in the field five years thereafter.\nThe ambitious plan will be an economic bonanza for the country's technology firms, as the area defined as core AI is expected to be valued at 150 billion yuan by 2020, while AI-related fields are valued at 1 trillion yuan, according to the government's forecast.

[Photo by Chai Hua\/China Daily]\nTHE HEADS OF all the major domestic information technology giants attended the 2017 China (Shenzhen) IT Summit held in Shenzhen in Guangdong province on Saturday, where they expressed their opinions on the new era of artificial intelligence and smart devices. Southern Metropolis Daily comments:\nJack Ma, founder and executive chairman of domestic e-commerce giant Alibaba, was quite frank in mentioning the challenges the Pearl River Delta region faces. He pointed out that the traditional manufacturing industries in the Pearl River Delta will be challenged by those offering tailored, personalized services in the coming 10 to 15 years.\nHis words hit the point. The manufacturing industries in the Pearl River Delta region have long been famous for producing standardized products ranging from radios in the 1980s and MP3s in the 2000s to smartphones today. They are good at making electronic products in large quantities.\nHowever, with AI technology constantly improving, it is increasingly more convenient for businesses to tailor their products and services to better suit consumers. That is a huge advantage over the traditional manufacturing industry that features standardization and uniformity.\nAt the same time, the Pearl River Delta enterprises face pressures from the rising cost of domestic labor, while the consumers' demands are increasing. All these make it necessary for the Pearl River Delta enterprises to change their business model and provide their own tailored products and services to consumers.\nSmart manufacturing can design large quantities of products that meet the diversified needs of consumers within quite a short time.\nMore important, technology can help solve the problem of the rising cost of labor. Intelligent machines can replace many workers that do repetitive labor in the traditional manufacturing industry. That is good news and a good opportunity for traditional manufacturing industries to turn from labor-intensive to technology-intensive operations.\nThe challenges that the enterprises in the Pearl River Delta face are also those that the global manufacturing industry faces as a whole. It is time they seized this opportunity and upgraded themselves to meet the requirements of the times.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/35\/149146322539.jpg\n00221917a33e1a4fbf0703.jpg\n","420":"The 2017 World Robot Conference will be held in Beijing from Aug 22 to 27, with various world-famous robot companies showcasing the latest robotic technologies that can handle work and daily tasks, like playing piano and performing a surgical operation.\u00a0\nThe conference will be hosted by Beijing Municipal Government, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and China Association for Science and Technology.

He rolled out the company's first 24-hour unattended convenience store in northern Shanghai's Yangpu district last month.\nSimilar to the Amazon Go's experimental outlet, there is no checkout or cashier.\nInstead, BingoBox provides more than 500 products, including snacks, drinks and even fruit.\nFor shoppers, the process is easy. First, they scan a QR code, via their smartphone, to open the store door.\nAfter that, they pick up their snacks and drinks before scanning them in the \"product identification area\". Payment is then made through a QR code that pops up on the screen to complete the transaction.\nAt that point, the door opens to let the customer out.

In the seafood sector, customers select what they want to buy, pay for it online before having it cooked to order.\nOr they can do the same online and have their orders delivered within 30 minutes as long as they are within three kilometers of the store.\n\"Up to 80 percent of the company's customers are born in the 1980s and 1990s (or Millennials),\" said Hou Yi, founder and chief executive officer of Hema Xiansheng. \"They are internet natives.\n\"This generation has grown up in an increasingly affluent China,\" he added. \"Therefore, they care more about quality and are less sensitive to prices.\"\nStill, what is important, is that the food is fresh and delivered on time.\nAs soon as you walk into a Hema Xiansheng supermarket, you hear a rattling sound above with shoppers and employees rushing around with mobile devices, picking up produce and other products from the shelves.\nThey then bundle them into shopping bags before some are clipped to hangers.

Does it physically exist? Is it a new frontier to explore and conquer? To hackers, cyberspace is as real as their living room, their neighbourhood, and their world. It's where they jack in and out to live, work, enjoy life and establish their sense of self.\u00a0\n It's like being a member of an elite underground club, where members carry on with their passions, oblivious to the surrounds yet constantly aware of treacheries from within and without, sizing up potential competition and alliances. As long as they behave and perform, they are in.\n Set in a not too distant future, Shanghai Dream is a \"cyberspace novel\" about what the future may hold when the need to explore and dominate brings our physical world together with cyberspace. Sahr Johnny's debut novel brings  realism to what life may be like inside and outside cyberspace in the future.\n The book opens with its protagonist, hacker Cad Caldwell, having been cut off from cyberspace, living out his last hours questioning whether his suicide will be swift. The language verges on the poetic as Johnny takes the reader inside his mind.\n But as Caldwell prepares to do the deed, a state-of-the-art console arrives from a senior member of the  Japanese underworld, the yakuza, and the hacker is back in action in cyberspace. Before long, his life is at stake and it's all he can do to stay alive.\n New China has made significant progress in artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and quantum computing. The world watches with cautious optimism as New China prepares to launch an artificial intelligence that will revolutionise the global community. Or subjugate it.\n From  yakuza-infiltrated Japanese politics and corrupt Chinese officials to a cybernetics-enhanced assassin and a secret cyberspace order from MI6, Johnny spins an intricate web of global conspiracy, technological warfare, blackmail, murder and a deadly plan to take over the world.\n His futuristic world is all the more believable as the reader is swept through London, New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, cities familiar but different. A sense of fear is nicely evoked.\n Despite, or perhaps because of, the clear writing about quantum computing, qubits, artificial intelligence and the virtual landscape of cyberspace and how humans interact with that world, Johnny has created a believable reality out of cyberspace.\n Although it sets up a sequel, Shanghai Dream is a self-contained and fast-paced action thriller. Johnny will do well to honour the \"To be continued ...\" tag as he has so far offered only a glimpse of cyberspace and what is to become of the physical world.\n","443":"With the World Cup just weeks away, Gordon Chin is particularly excited as the event also marks the big kick-off for his company's new children's soccer animation television series, AI Football GGO.  \nThe series will be shown in over 40 countries - a record for a Chinese-made children's animation series - and Chin is still in negotiations with another 20 to 30 countries. It will also appear on over 80 channels on the mainland.\nNext month the series will premiere in South Africa on the e.tv  channel that will broadcast the World Cup. \u00a0\n\"It's World Cup year and many countries are looking for an animation series for kids that has to do with football. We've been working on this project for over two years and planned to launch it during the World Cup,\" Chin said. \"Our timing has been perfect and we are reaping the benefits. The closer we get to the World Cup the more countries are signing up.\" \nAI Football GGO stands for \"Artificial Intelligence Football Go Goal Ole\" and will be dubbed into at least eight different languages. It follows a club side through national and regional qualifying until it gets to the World Club Championships. All the sides use artificial intelligence to improve their chances of victory.\n\"We did not want to make the story too localised because we wanted to sell it to a world audience,\" Chin said. \nIt's very much a family business. Chin's father, Yiu-tong, is the managing director of M & C Toys and has been in the toy business for over 30 years in Hong Kong. Five years ago Chin decided to branch out and start his own animation company, Puzzle Animation,  which is based in Shenzhen.\n\"Toys and animation are always related so it was my dream to invest in an animation company in China. It was then we bought Puzzle Animation and from that moment on we produced our own animation features in China.\" \nWhen Chin started the company he knew nothing about animation and had to learn the process from scratch. Initially he had a staff of 30 people but a year later this had risen to 100. His first project in 2007 was a collaboration with the People's Liberation Army when he made Sparkling Red Star, which was based on the same titled novel written by Li Xintian.  \n What Chin soon realised was that although the animated film was good quality, he had a lot to learn about the distribution and promotional side of the industry. The movie was not a financial success. \nIt was a learning curve for Chin but it wasn't all bad news. The PLA were so happy with the final product that they gave his father's M & C Toys the rights to make PLA action toys. They are sold in over 200 retail outlets on the mainland and eight in Hong Kong.\nChin's second animation film, released in 2008, Storm Rider - Clash of Evils, was a breakthrough. Based on the Wuxia comic series Fung Wan  by Ma Wing-shing,  the film broke box-office records throughout China for an animated Chinese-made film. Chin also clinched an international distribution deal for the film.\n\"Finally we had established ourselves ... but we wanted to do more. It was then that we decided to do AI Football GGO and it has proved to be a big success.\"\n","444":"As many technology companies are joining the healthcare industry, artificial intelligence will drive the development of a new smart health model in the future, experts said on Thursday.\nThe smart health industry has integrated the latest achievements of information technology and medical science, said Li Bin, minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission.\u00a0\nShe made the comment while addressing a forum during the third World Internet Conference, which opened in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, on Wednesday.\nShe said smart health is becoming the leading force to drive the development of China's health industry and a new health care service model is emerging.\nLast month, the State Council, the country's cabinet, issued the \"Healthy China 2030\" blueprint, which aims to expand the size of health service industry to 16 trillion yuan ($2.35 trillion) by 2030.\nZhan Qimin, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and president of the Peking University Health Science Center, affirms AI technology is the driving force in the new smart health industry, especially in the development of precision medicine.\nHe noted China is seeing a surge in chronic non-communicable and critical diseases, and precision medicine can provide precise and efficient therapy to improve the overall health and well-being.\nAI techniques, such as representation machine learning, could offer improved clinical prediction regarding disease risks, therapeutic effect, and prognosis prediction, compared with traditional tools, he added.\nMoreover, he noted the machine learning framework could provide clinical decision support and policy simulation, which would definitely improve the effectiveness and efficiency of precision medicine.\nRobin Li, chairman and CEO of Baidu, said AI technology also plays an important role in accelerating the development of genetic medicine.\nHe said it is one of the most \"exciting\" application areas of AI technology and there will be many breakthroughs and opportunities in the field.\nSo far, genetic editing is mostly applied in the treatment of some rare diseases, he said.\nThe internet giant has developed Baidu Brain based on its artificial intelligence technology.

It has a lot of data, it has lots of big tech companies which are well positioned to develop,\" Walsh said.\n\"It is making very strong bets in this area, so I imagine that China is going to do very well out of this revolution.\"\nChina's State Council has announced the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan that will see China take steps to become a global innovation center in this field.\nAI has already begun to manifest itself in ways which most people do not realize, and Walsh said that it has been happening as a gradual process and will continue to do so, albeit at a somewhat faster pace as the technology improves and develops.\n\"AI is becoming more and more widespread in our lives, people don't realize it's there. Every time you speak to your smartphone, every time you get a product recommendation, every time you use the satellite navigation system in your car, you are using a bit of AI,\" Walsh said.\n\"Eventually it will become like electricity, it will be everywhere. In every room, in every car, in every device, we will be using AI - it will be the operating system of the future.\"\nChina's role in the AI sphere is also comforting to Walsh, who said that he feels worried that the benefits of the rapid advancements in technology that will be made will potentially be too isolated as they are often \"winner take all markets\" driven by the network effects of the technology.\n\"There's only one search engine on the planet - Google - outside of China. There's only one social media network on the planet - Facebook - outside of China. There's only one twitter like service, messaging service, on the planet - Twitter - outside of China,\" Walsh said.\n\"The reason that China has had the good sense to protect their own market is that they then have some competition, and if we don't do enough there will be so much power, so much wealth, concentrated into the hands of a few corporations, that they will be wealthier than countries, and they are not answerable like countries - to the people.\"\nAs China continues to make rapid advancements in the AI field and continues to invest heavily into the research and development aspect of this emerging technology, recent studies show that China is poised to become and possibly surpass all others in the pursuit of AI technological eminence.\nThese studies, such as a recent McKinsey Global Institute report that suggested within that not only will China be able to deploy AI technology successfully due to its \"wide range of industries proving a fertile market for deployment,\" but also could potentially broaden the scope from the domestic level to a more international approach.\n\"Artificial intelligence has the potential to fundamentally shape our society for many decades to come. It is a uniquely powerful tool that China can deploy to boost its productivity and maintain its growth trajectory,\" the report said.\n\"The technology industry is becoming increasingly global. China has the capability and opportunity to lead international collaboration in the development and governance of AI, ensuring that this breakthrough technology will positively contribute to the general welfare of all humanity.\"\n","450":"The Digital Reading Conference China 2018 will be held in April in Hangzhou, the capital of East China's Zhejiang province.\u00a0\nAt the conference, announcements will include names of the top 10 digital works and projects of 2017 as well as the 10 cities with the most number of digital readers and highest number of reading activities for last year.\nAround 1,200 people from the publishing world, business leaders, writers and scholars are expected to attend the opening ceremony on April 13.

The final generation could even talk.\nBy 2006, Sony was in trouble. Its business model was broken, and it was facing fierce competition from rivals in all fields. The AIBO, an expensive and somewhat frivolous luxury, had to go.\nThe company kept its AIBO Clinic open until March, but then told the owners that they were on their own.\nFor Hideko Mori, 70, that nearly spelled disaster.\nMori has had her AIBO for about eight years. She enjoys the conversations she has with it, and thinks it far more convenient than a real puppy.

Scattered around him are dozens of AIBOs sent in with problems owners typically describe as \"aching joints\".\n\"For those who keep AIBOs, they are nothing like home appliances. It's obvious they think of it as a family member,\" he said.\nFunabashi said he does not enhance the functions of aged AIBOs, but tries to restore them to health.\nThe problem is that repairs can take weeks or even months because of a shortage of spare parts.

We've now become one of the late movers.\"\nRead: China's Mobvoi steps up artificial intelligence efforts\nMobvoi, last week unveiled its Tichome, a 999 yuan (US$150) smart speaker that plays music, helps users search for the nearest hotel, sets alarms, controls household electrical appliances, all through a voice-activated operating menu, in Putonghua.\nChina is already the largest market for smartphones on the planet, with 538.2 million handsets sold last year, valued at US$133.5 billion. Analysts say the Next Big Thing will be even bigger.\nThe smartphone is the prevailing interface \"to access information and services in the digital age,\" said Jin Di, IDC China's research manager. \"The smart speaker may be the next big thing when more devices are connected. It is a nascent but a potential market with no market leader. So everyone wants to jump in to grab a slice of the market share.\"\nAmazon's Echo, the first in the market, already sets the bar for wannabe developers to aspire to. The company has already shipped 100 million units since 2014 of the US$179.99 speaker, which also spawned a US$44.99 offspring called the Echo Dot.\nCompetition is aplenty in China. Alibaba Group Holdings, which surpassed Amazon as the world's largest online shopping platform -- and owns the South China Morning Post -- has a smart speaker called the Tmall Genie X1, which sells for 499 yuan.\nXiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker that's usurped larger global brands as the best-selling smartphone in India has a model called the MiSmart Network Speaker, selling for 299 yuan.\nTencent Holdings, whose mobile game Honour of Kings is played actively by as many as 80 million people everyday, is working on what it calls a \"smart box\".\nEven Baidu, the dominant Chinese internet search operator that's trying to remake itself into an AI company, has its me-too smart speaker called Xiaoyu Zaijia, or Small Fish, selling for 1,999 yuan. The Beijing-based company also has a voice-activated platform called DurOs, not unlike Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri, that allows hardware developers to tap into its voice recognition platform to build their own speakers.\nRead: Baidu's 'small fish' takes on Amazon Echo and Google Home\n\"There's definitely a bubble forming in the market around these smart speakers, because no one wants to miss the big opportunity,\" said Zhu Mingming, founder of Hangzhou-based Rokid, an AI startup that has sold 10,000 talking speakers within a month of their launch in May. \"This is the future. There's nothing better than a talking speaker at the centre of your AI-powered smart home.\"\nStill, not everyone is equally sanguine, or confident of the devices' future. The success of Amazon's Echo is due to the large population of full-time housewives in America, said Xie Dianxia, founder of the Chinese startup Ruyi, which also has a voice-activated chatbot in the works.\n\"They spend a lot of time at home and enjoy interacting with Echo while they are cooking,\" he said. \"This is not the case with China. Young people tend to dine out to socialise, and there is no time for them to use talking speakers at home.\"\nFor salespeople, it may still be early days before the wider consumer market understands, accepts and seeks out smart speakers, said Li Huiqiang, a salesman who sells electric products in Huaqiangbei, a major electronics manufacturing hub in Shenzhen.\n\"It's a good day if I can sell even one or two pieces every day,\" Li said. \"I don't think most people know what the functions of a smart speaker is, and very few people buys the product.I do not believe the smart speaker will be as popular as smartphones in China.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

China's fourth-largest State-owned commercial lender by assets - is exploring smarter ways to allocate financial resources, improve efficiency and control risks by using artificial intelligence and big data technologies.\n\"Among all kinds of financial technologies, we care most about those promoting intelligentization, which will help us allocate financial resources more precisely,\" said Yan Dawei, deputy general manager of the BOC's e-finance department.\nThe new version of its mobile app released on Tuesday introduced a real-time risk monitoring and control system.\nThrough its partnership with Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, BOC has developed a risk analysis model based on data the bank collects from its clients, using technology provided by Tencent Cloud.\n\"The system will improve the safety of online and mobile banking transactions for our clients. It will also eliminate any sense of inconvenience during the transaction process, by removing the need to enter a verification code for certain transactions,\" said Zuo Juexi, a risk management administrator at BOC.\nOn Feb 1, the system issued fraud risk alerts on 5,408 transactions, flagging 0.107 percent of the 5,054,265 transactions cleared on the BOC's online and mobile banking platforms that day.\nIn addition to enhancing risk management, with the new mobile banking app the bank also allows its clients to open a mobile banking account and link a debit card to that account via facial recognition identification.\n\"Mobile banking has become a major battlefield that each bank is entering with massive force. It is also a key arena for the application of new technologies,\" said Yan of the BOC's e-finance department.\nAccording to Yan, after several years of development, mobile banking has now reached the integration stage. Clients want to know their overall capital earnings and the risks associated with their investments, he explained. What they need is integrated financial solutions, rather than a range of different products, which requires a bank to offer customer-centric services on its mobile banking platform by integrating its products, information and workflow, he said.\nIn the meantime, there is a trend of commercial banks cooperating with internet and fintech companies to introduce business scenarios for consumption, payment, borrowing and investment on their own platforms, Yan added.\nIn addition to its partnership with Tencent, BOC is also working with leading Chinese search engine Baidu to deliver more useful answers to netizens' questions about the bank. Next, the bank will embed services, such as online reservations to exchange money, reinforcing an edge over its peers.\nSome of the bank's other plans include facilitating crossborder QR code payments in Hong Kong after the Lunar New Year celebrations starting Feb 16, and later expanding the service to Macao and Singapore. It will also launch an online robo-advisory product, which is still in the trial phase among client managers, said Yan.\nStarting from 2017, banks have strengthened their efforts to develop their consumer loan products. As the pricing of consumer loans is usually based on personal credit rather than collaterals, banks must have a strong risk pricing ability, so fintech companies have stepped in and have had a huge effect on the sector, said Sophie Jiang, a banking analyst at Nomura. \"The rise of fintech in 2016 and 2017 has provided a great opportunity for banks to enter the consumer loan business with the help of financial technologies, under the premise that the cost and risks of such business are controllable.\n\"Banks are now turning towards retail banking and inclusive finance. During the process of transition, fintech will play an increasingly important role,\" Jiang said.\njiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn\nA child interacts with Bank of China's robot receptionist during the 25th China International Financial Exhibition in Beijing.

Later, he worked at P&G, a Fortune 500 company, for two years as product manager in R&D and another year as consultant with Mars & Co, a global boutique management consulting firm.\nIn 2006, he decided to strike it out on his own, when the startup culture was not as glamorous as it is today.\u00a0\nIn 2006, Yan and his friends founded AdMaster. \"Being an entrepreneur can be lonely, especially in the beginning,\" he said. \"It's not until the fifth year that we received our first round of venture capital funding from GSR Ventures (in 2010).\"\nThe second round was from Wi Happer Group in 2012.\nAfter the advent of artificial intelligence and big data, he and his team figured that ad metrics alone would not satisfy the firm's clients. AdMaster needed to grow, to keep pace with the changing times.\n\"What we wanted to do is not only help our customers to identify their problems but also provide them with trustworthy solutions,\" Yan said.\nIn the past few years, AdMaster has transformed itself from a digital ad analytics firm into a provider of big data- and artificial intelligence - based marketing solutions.\nAccording to Yan, Jingshuo Technology Group, which now includes four independent business divisions (AdMaster, nEqual, Jinshuju and Tuice), was formed recently to offer a one-stop service covering marketing measurement and solutions, data intelligence technology, SmartForm tools, intelligent social customer service and customer relationship management.\nSo far, Jingshuo Technology Group has covered 80 percent of brands of fast-moving consumer goods or FMCG players such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever and L'Oreal, and more than 60 percent of the world's automobile brands.\nThe group's target clients are not restricted to big brands. \"I also want to help small and middle-sized enterprises. Our dream is to build a world in which each business will be conducted easily.\"\nSmall and medium-sized businesses currently account for 3 percent of the group's revenue, but in the next three to five years, the number is expected to grow to 15 percent, Yan said.\nIn the future, AdMaster will be committed to becoming a global brand, he said. \"This would mean more competition with international brands, including US-based Oracle and measurement company Nielsen,\" he said.\nSo, it is vital that AdMaster figures out its strengths. \"Our service from Tuice and Jinshuju can help small and medium businesses find and seize opportunities from social networks,\" he said. \"Therefore, we can attract more small clients.\"\nAdMaster, he said, achieved annual sales growth of 50 percent in the past several years. But he declined to share absolute figures and the timeline.\nHe attributed his knowledge of corporate needs and market trends to his 13 years in the field of digital marketing in China. His past experience, he said, enables him to combine marketing services with internet technology.\n\"From that experience, I've learned a lot of things about marketing, consumers and data analysis, which proved to be useful later when I started my own business.\"\nHe said he expects AdMaster to list in China in the near future. \"The valuations of firms such as AdMaster will be more attractive in the mainland market compared with those in Hong Kong or New York.\"\nThat could also pose a challenge because many firms are lining up for listing in China. However, Yan is optimistic. \"Success will come when the time is ripe. We've a good team, so neither us nor our investors are going to worry because of that.\"\nAmong the firm's core values, he considers \"trust\" a big strength. \"You've to put yourself in a good position so that others could trust you,\" said Yan. \"Some companies used to be popular in the advertising industry, but they gradually declined because they could not earn their clients' trust.\"\nAsked about advice for startups, he said: \"An entrepreneur should start up in a field he or she is good at ... so, beginning from a vantage point is crucially important.\"\nFan Hang and Niu Yilin contributed to this story.\nhuyuanyuan@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 02\/05\/2018 page15)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/99\/151779171892.jpg\nf04da2db11221be1e46919.jpg\n","466":"Macao and Alibaba Cloud will work together to upgrade the special administrative region (SAR) into a smart city by applying cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\u00a0\nMacao Special Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Office Director O Lam and President of Alibaba Cloud Hu Xiaoming sign the Strategic Cooperation Framework Agreement to Build Smart City at a ceremony presided by SAR Chief Executive Chui Sai On (2nd R) and the board of directors of Alibaba Group Jack Ma (2nd L), in Macao, China, Aug 4, 2017.

A video on its website features a robot version of science writer Philip K. Dick, who tells a smiling interviewer: \"Don't worry, even if I evolve into Terminator, I will still be nice to you.\" \nWhile the wires protruding from its head show its evolution to Terminator has a long way to go, the invention is part of a fast-evolving field of technology.  \u00a0\nMay also saw Hong Kong-based venture capital fund Deep Knowledge Ventures add some artificial intelligence to its board - a learning program called Vital capable of making investment recommendations. \nWorldwide, there are numerous developments taking place in the field of robotics. Some are comical, a few are downright scary. \nPerhaps the scariest is South Korea's SGR-1 robot sentry. Developed by Samsung Techwin, it stands around half the height of a human. There's no attempt to resemble a person. Instead, it totes a machine gun plus a grenade launcher, which can be swivelled and aimed based on heat and motion sensors capable of detecting humans up to three kilometres away. \nThough a promotional video conjures up scenes from Robocop, there's no concern that SGR-1 might become self-aware and rampage against its creators, as it requires a remote human operator to give permission to open fire. Since 2006, an undisclosed number of these sentries have been keeping watch along the border between North and South Korea. They never lose concentration, and are always watching.  \nSamsung Techwin spokesman Huh Kwang-hak was quoted in Britain's Daily Mail newspaper as saying: \"The SGR-1 can and will prevent wars.\" \nHuh would probably see potential for even greater \"war prevention\" in a \"robotic cheetah\" that researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology unveiled last week. It is the size of a dog, and can run at up to 16 km\/h and leap over small hurdles. Though still slow compared to humans, the researchers think they can triple its speed, making it more than a match for sprinter Usain Bolt. Perhaps we'll soon see a dystopian movie featuring a rampaging platoon of machine-gun-equipped cheetah robots, enforcing order according to the whims of their programmers. \nA Harvard University team last month showed off a swarm of tiny robots, each a few centimetres across, which can organise themselves to form two-dimensional shapes like a star. With each robot only able to communicate with and measure distances from each of its neighbours, they collaborate until the overall pattern is created. Noting similarities with biological systems, lead researcher Radhika Nagpal  at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said, \"At some level, you no longer even see the individuals; you just see the collective as an entity to itself.\" \nRobots are also working with people. Collaborative robots now roam some factories, performing a variety of tasks that are too onerous for humans, who might then be free to perform other duties - or free to seek work elsewhere. These are smaller and cheaper than the large robots that hitherto featured on production lines, and instead of being caged for safety reasons, they have sensors so they can slow down or halt if a collision appears likely. One of the best known collaborative robots is called Baxter, which even has a computer screen to signal \"emotions\" such as puzzlement. \nIf you would like help with the housework, take note of Boris. The British robot can assess unfamiliar objects and determine how best to pick them up with a five-fingered hand on a robotic arm. Billed as being one day able to load a dishwasher, Boris copes well with cups and plates, but struggles with knives and forks. \nThe need for robots to be taught behaviour or be taught to learn it for themselves could change with a project using cloud technology. Aiming to create a wealth of knowledge in the cloud, for access by robots, the project is called RoboBrain. If you've seen any of the Terminator films, you may immediately think of similarities with Skynet, the artificial intelligence that controlled defence systems and then unleashed them against the human race.

In an article for Britain's Independent newspaper, they wrote that there are no fundamental limits to what can be achieved, adding: \"So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong.\" Little serious research is being conducted regarding the pitfalls; it's time to ask how to improve the chances of reaping the benefits while avoiding the risks. \nWhile the risks from killer robots loom large in the popular imagination, it is possible that some humans will become sex slaves to robots. Robot girlfriends have already appeared.  Professor Adrian Cheok of City University London is giving the keynote speech during the Festival of the Mind in northern England this month, in which he will address \"telepresence\" technologies which will blend the virtual and the physical and may even result in sexual relationships between humans and robots.  \nSomeday robots may even be equipped to write news reports, replacing the journalist's byline with that of a tireless, utterly objective robotic science writer. \nMartin Williams is a Hong Kong-based writer specialising in conservation and the environment.

In their case, sales is very much driven by relationship building.\n\nThe nation's largest insurer China Life still has 1.58 million agents, while number two Ping An has over 1.1 million, and both have previously made much of their plans to expand their sales forces soon.\n\nThe two firms now appear to be shifting their focus towards technology investment, in the mainland and Hong Kong, and are banking on artificial intelligence and big data to boost online sales of insurance products.\n\nChina Life said last Thursday that it had teamed up with internet search firm Baidu to form a seven billion yuan (HK$8.3 billion) fund for investment in AI-related technology companies and internet finance operations. China Life will plough 5.6 billion yuan into the venture, with Baidu covering the rest.\n\nChina Life chairman Yang Mingsheng said on Friday that the investment would help in boosting returns and expand its AI and other technological capabilities, which he believes would become paramount to future development.\n\nPing An, headed by founder and chairman Peter Ma Mingzhe, has been focusing on expansion of its online activities for the past five years, spending 1 per cent of its annual revenue or a total of around US$1 billion a year.\n\nThis has allowed the business to diversify into internet lending and create a wealth management financial platform, via Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange (Lufax).

In the runup to the meeting, China Daily interviewed business leaders from major multinational companies for their views on economic developments here and the country's global leadership role.\u00a0\nWhat do you feel has been China's biggest achievement during the past five years and what is its most notable change?\nIt has to be the way that China has embraced a digital transformation like few other nations in the world. The fourth industrial revolution, which everyone talked about, has arrived. This has come about through cloud computing, edge devices and big data.\nIt is changing how people in China live and work, and it is injecting new energy into all walks of life. It is beginning to transform businesses, helping them empower their employees, engage customers, optimize operations and (change) both the products they create and sell. In fact, their business models.\nThis did not occur by accident. China set a clear course with policies to support the transformation of the economy from one fueled by manufacturing and investment to one driven by technology and innovation. Those decisions are beginning to bear fruit.\nAs a Fortune 500 company, which sectors do you think offer the most opportunities for development?\nChina is one of the most dynamic places for economic growth and innovation in the world. The entire country is going through a digital transformation, driven by technology and innovation. So, it is no surprise that digital transformation tops the agenda among business leaders across the country.\nIn meetings with businesses and government leaders, it is clear that organizations are accelerating their digital transformation journeys. They are asking us how they can (turn) their data into growth assets and how they can change their business models to align with new market realities.\nIn a survey Microsoft commissioned of about 1,500 business decision-makers across the Asia-Pacific, we found that digital transformation was already a priority for most organizations in China. Up to 87 percent agree the key to future growth was to think and act like a digital business.\nWhat are your expectations for the upcoming 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and what key issues will you be watching for?\nAt Microsoft, we are naturally very interested in the policies affecting the technology industry. Will there be policies, directives and guidelines like \"Internet Plus\" and the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan? If so, what sort of direction will they provide for the road ahead?\nMicrosoft is really a partner-centric company\uff0dmore than 1,000 Chinese companies are building solutions and services based on our cloud platform today\uff0dand the fortunes and future direction of these technology enterprises will be affected by government policies.\nSo, we hope to continue to learn about and align with these policies in ways which lead to success for everyone, as we have done for many years.\nWhat factors will boost China's growth this year and in 2018, and what are the challenges facing China's economy?\nTransforming one of the largest economies in the world is certainly a challenge. But a successful response will provide enormous opportunities for China and for the world. Innovation-driven technologies and applications are disrupting traditional industries such as never before.\nBig data, cloud services, IoT (the internet of things), and AI (artificial intelligence) will breathe new life into every industry and sector to help transform the economy.\nMicrosoft has been (helping to) transform China for more than 20 years and will remain a partner with the country through the years ahead. We will provide technologies, platforms, services and support to fuel innovation and entrepreneurship.\nWhat opportunities will the Belt and Road Initiative throw up for China and the rest of the world?\nChinese companies are ahead of the curve in digital transformation and they will help drive the country's development, as well as the development of partners along the Belt and Road routes. The partnerships in technology and innovation, which will be built between China and other economies, will provide a good foundation for multilateral cooperation.\nMobike (Technology Co Ltd) is a good example of what we can see happening as Chinese companies grow. They are using intelligent cloud technologies to reinvent transportation inside the country and now around the world with smart bike sharing.\nThey use Microsoft's Azure intelligent cloud platform, IoT and predictive analytics to understand where their bikes are, and where they are needed. This innovative solution helps solve problems in congested cities and can help build the reputation of Chinese companies more broadly.\nWhat are the most innovative trends or products in China?\nAI (artificial intelligence) is the most innovative thing happing in China today. Because AI is still in its infancy, it is just starting to be taken seriously by companies around the world. China, however, has been ahead of the game in AI research in some respects. In applying AI, the country has an advantage.\nNaturally, Microsoft has been working on artificial intelligence for many years.

It can take as long as two decades for a nuclear sub to progress from an idea on a blueprint to the finished product, sliding down a slipway.\nArtificial\u00a0intelligence bot beats humans at reading in a first for machines\nBut the subs' computer brains have generally been out of sync with their state-of-the-art image.\nFirst, the technology in most submarine computers tends to predate the vessel's commissioning. Furthermore, military-grade electronic components have required extensive battle-hardening to withstand shocks, heat or electromagnetic disturbance, sacrificing speed for reliability.\nUp till now, the \"thinking\" function on a nuclear sub, including interpreting and answering signals picked up by sonar, a system for detecting objects under water by emitting sound pulses, has been handled almost exclusively by human naval personnel, not by machines.\nNow, through AI technology, a convolutional neural network undergirds so-called machine learning. This structure underpins a decision support system that can acquire knowledge, improve skills and develop new strategy without human intervention.\nBy mimicking the workings of the human brain, the system can process a large amount of data. On a nuclear submarine, data could come from the Chinese navy's rapidly increasing observation networks, the submarine's own sensors or daily interactions with the crew.\nArtificial\u00a0intelligence will change the job market and Hong Kong isn't ready\nAn AI assistant could support commanding officers by assessing the battlefield environment, providing insight into how levels of saline in the ocean and water temperature might affect the accuracy of sonar systems.\nIt also could recognise and flag threats from an enemy faster and more accurately than human operators.\nAn AI assist also could help commanding officers estimate the risks and benefits of certain combat manoeuvres, even suggesting moves not considered by the vessel's captain.\nChina's military wants the new AI technology to deliver on certain basic demands, according to the researcher.\nA priority is ensuring the system can follow and understand sophisticated, ever-changing underwater operations. It also must have a simple structure to reduce its risk of failure. And it must be compact and compatible with subs' existing computer systems.\n\"It is like putting an elephant into a shoebox,\" said the researcher when asked about the challenge of the project.\n'It is not science fiction': AI experts warn of new global arms race for killer robots, call for ban\n\"What the military cares most about is not fancy features. What they care most is the thing does not screw up amid the heat of a battle.\"\nThe military currently has no plan to reduce the size of submarine crews when the AI technology is ready for deployment. \"There must be a human hand on every critical post. This is for safety redundancy,\" the researcher said.\nBeijing, which takes the AI submarine programme very seriously, is ploughing abundant resources into the undertaking, according to the researcher.\nChina's move highlights the spectre of a widening AI technology gap. The existence of the AI sub tech divide was underscored by the comment of a US military systems executive taking part in a survey last year by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency on \"disruptive technologies\" that a hostile country could use against Americans.\nJoe Marino, CEO of Rite-Solutions, a technical company supporting the US Naval Undersea System Command, touted the value of using AI to enhance submarine commanding officers' decision-making powers.\nIn the age of artificial intelligence, can we rise to the challenge of mass unemployment?\n\"[Without matching other countries' advances in AI submarine technology] our CO (commanding officers) would be fighting an opponent who could make faster, more informed and better decisions,\" Marino wrote in an article on the company's website.\n\"Combined with undersea technology advancements by near-peer competitors such as Russia and China in areas such as stealth, sensors, weapons, this 'cognitive advantage' could threaten US undersea dominance,\" he wrote.\nMarino urged the US navy to embrace AI and challenge America's defence industry to investigate the possible application of the technology on US submarines.\nZhu Min, a researcher at the Institute of Acoustics with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a lead scientist in China's deep water exploration programme, said AI has been a fashionable word in China's submarine research community for the past couple of years.\n\"In the past, the technology was too distant from application, but recently a lot of progress has been achieved,\" he said. \"There seems to be hope around the corner.\"\nWhere traditional computer programs on submarines have needed \"step-by-step\" human guidance, AI has the potential to \"change the game under the sea\", Zhu said.\nChina enlists top scientists in mission to become military tech superpower\nAI algorithms usually run on large, state-of-the-art computers, requiring intensive calculation to process a huge amount of data.\nRecent technical advancements, however, have suggested it may be possible for these algorithms - translated in layman's terms as rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps - to be executed on small machines.\nAlphaGo, a computer program that plays the board game Go, developed by Google's Deep Mind, for instance, initially required several powerful computers. After two years it achieved much higher performance with only a tenth of the calculating hardware.\nAlphaGo Zero, the newest version of the program, no longer needs to learn how to play the game better from a human player. It can teach itself to be a better player without human help.\nZhu said using AI on a strategic weaponry platform such as a nuclear submarine would be a natural next step for the evolving technology. Letting it seek new knowledge without restraint, however, could lead to unexpected consequences.\nIf the system started to have its own way of thinking, \"we may have a runaway submarine with enough nuclear arsenals to destroy a continent,\" he said, describing what sounded like the plot of a science-fiction film or novel.\nJapan trials AI-assisted predictive policing before 2020 Tokyo Olympics\n\"This is definitely a risk the authorities should consider when introducing AI to a sub.\"\nDeng Zhidong, a computer science professor and AI scholar at Beijing's Tsinghua University, said the risk of AI-based machines' rebelling against human society did not exist - at least for the foreseeable future.\n\"An AI-powered machine is still a machine. It does not have a life,\" he said.\nAn AI system on a submarine, though sophisticated, in many ways would be similar to self-driving technology on some cars, Deng said.\n\"You can shut it down and shift to manual any time. It will be the same on a nuclear submarine.\"\nCopyright (c) 2018. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

AlphaGo got 1 million US dollars in prize which will be donated to charities.\nThe human Go champion beat the artificial intelligence (AI), developed by Google's London-based AI subsidiary DeepMind, in the fourth match, but Lee was defeated once again in the final match.\nDespite the sweeping victory, it is too early to say that AI has surpassed humans in Go because Lee fought AlphaGo with little known about the computer program, including a playing style and a strategy, one commentator said.\nOnly after analyzing AlphaGo's strategy sufficiently and holding a match once again between the AI and human Go players, it can be determined whether machines may surpass humans in the board game, the commentator said.\nLee and AlphaGo exchanged 280 moves for five hours, the longest among the five games that kicked off last Wednesday in Seoul. Lee displayed a fighting spirit to the last minute, but he eventually lost by a narrow margin.\nThe 33-year-old kept a tight game with the two-year-old computer program by the middle of the match, but a decisive moment came past halfway as AlphaGo succeeded in attacking the lower-left side\nAt the lower-left side, AlphaGo made questionable moves, which looked like blunders at the first sight, but those also proved to be a strategy to win more territory in hindsight.\nCommentators said AlphaGo made excellent moves in the latter half of the game, proving its better capability to play as time goes on.

The 27-year-old programmer says he already regrets not asking for more money - he currently earns 400,000 yuan (HK$472,000) a year not including options - and is now actively looking for a \u00adbetter-paying position.\n\n\"My friends advised me to stay put and complete at least a full year so that it won't look bad on my resume,\" said Wei, who has a postgraduate degree in applied mathematics from Harbin \u00adInstitute of Technology. It is one of China's best-known universities, along with Tsinghua and Peking, when it comes to \u00adscience and engineering.\u00a0\n\nBut with more than 10 recruiters calling him with job offers since the start of the year, the \u00adadvice from his friends is looking increasingly outdated.\n\nWei is one of the estimated 300,000 people in the world who have the required skills in \u00adadvanced computer science that underpin developments from driverless cars to home robots.\n\nThe global demand for AI \u00adexperts like himself is in the \u00admillions, according to a report by Tencent \u00adResearch, a unit of China's \u00adTencent Holdings.\n\nThe AI talent shortage is \u00adexpected to be one of the issues that comes up for discussion at the annual closed-door Central Economic Work Conference this month, where members of the ruling Communist Party and \u00adgovernment department heads gather to discuss how to implement the vision for a technologically advanced nation set forth earlier this year by President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe conference sets the course for key economic policies over the next year and delegates will likely discuss measures needed to achieve the targets set out in July when the State Council issued a road map to develop an AI \u00adindustry worth over 1 trillion yuan by 2030.\n\nDubbed the fourth industrial revolution, the rise of AI - powerful supercomputers that crunch data to identify patterns and teach themselves tasks - has fuelled concerns over its potential to put people out of work.\n\nOne estimate by management consultancy McKinsey forecasts that 800 million jobs worldwide are at risk of being lost to automation by 2030.\n\nIn China, technology companies like Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the South China Morning Post, are experimenting with unstaffed convenience stores and warehouses, and using AI to determine credit scores for Chinese consumers. JD.com, the online retailer, just announced an investment in driverless vehicles and is using drones to deliver \u00adparcels. Insurers and banks are using AI technology to power their ATMs and improve the customer risk-assessment process.\n\nAll of these artificial intelligence initiatives, ironically, \u00adrequire an abundance of human brainpower, which is why people such as Wei are in demand.\n\nAs of March, there were more than 1.9 million technology \u00adprofessionals working in the AI sector globally, according to LinkedIn statistics. While the US accounts for the lion's share with 850,000, China ranked seventh with just over 50,000, trailing \u00adIndia, Britain and Canada and on par with \u00adAustralia and France.\n\nChina's demand for AI professionals might surge to 5 million in a few years, People's Daily reported, citing Zhou Ming, an education vice-director at the Ministry of \u00adIndustry and Information \u00adTechnology.\n\nSo far, China has been importing most of its AI talent from overseas because its home-grown AI talent remains scarce, according to LinkedIn's Global AI Talent report published in July.\n\nRoughly nine out of 10 AI positions advertised on the mainland go unfilled, unless companies venture out of China to hire, \u00adaccording to the professional networking platform. The number of China-based AI job postings on LinkedIn surged more than eight times over the past three years, from about 50,000 in 2014 to 440,000 in 2016, said Wang Di, vice-president of LinkedIn China.\n\nAbout 44 per cent of the \u00adoverseas AI talent working in China comes from the US, \u00adfollowed by Britain and France as the second and third source countries, according to LinkedIn.\n\nResearchers in machine learning, smart chips and algorithms are the most sought-after, according to Wang. Demand will \u00adcontinue to grow, with a survey by global risk advisory company Willis Towers Watson showing that Chinese tech firms project an average 20 per cent expansion in their AI teams next year.\n\n\"Many Chinese tech companies now visit top universities and headhunting firms on a regular basis, keeping an eye out and learning about the market. Their overseas recruitment plans would even have no limit when it comes to headcount or budget,\" said Willis Towers Watson managing director Edward Hsu.\n\nIn terms of recruitment strategies, Hsu said Chinese companies first tried poaching AI talent from leading peers as well as hiring fresh graduates from home and abroad. Longer term, they were setting up overseas labs to attract foreign researchers and expatriate Chinese unwilling to return to China, while some were looking at outright acquisitions of competitors as a means to acquire the \u00adtalent, he added.\n\nIndeed, a Silicon Valley presence is now seen as standard for any Chinese company serious about working in AI. Car hailing company Didi Chuxing, China's answer to Uber, opened a US-based research lab in March after successfully poaching seasoned cybersecurity experts, including a former Uber researcher known for being able to hack cars with a laptop computer from miles away.\n\nTencent opened its own AI lab in Seattle, Washington state, in May while Alibaba pledged in \u00adOctober to invest over US$15 \u00adbillion on AI research and development over the next three years, with a plan to open seven labs worldwide aimed at beating \u00adsimilar research facilities built by IBM, Microsoft and Intel.\n\nShortage of talent might \u00adbecome the biggest barrier for China to achieve its AI dreams, said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and \u00adInternational Studies, a US-based think tank.\n\n\"Its AI road map is good, but China may need more time to build the workforce,\" he said, adding that nurturing and growing a talent pool in technology can be a slow process.\n\nEven so, China's economic strength and willingness to spend money gave it an advantage over the US or Europe, Lewis said.\n\nThe global AI race was coming down to a competition between US and Chinese companies for the small pool of talent, and the \u00adrecent Chinese \"brain drain\" was being reversed now that good AI scientists were being offered a \"fair amount of pay\" to work in China, he said.\n\nWith over 700 AI-related companies in China, about US$2.6 \u00adbillion of capital has flowed into the industry over the past four years or so, roughly one seventh of the amount going into the United States but three times that of Britain, according to a report by the Wuzhen Institute and NetEase.\n\nFor Wei, the AI programmer in Beijing, the talent shortage is good news.\n\n\"When I land at the next start-up, a 30 per cent pay rise will be the least I'll get, although I could offer some discount if it's already a tech giant,\" he said.\n\nHowever, coming from a \u00adremote village in Shandong \u00adprovince, Wei admits to being shy about discussing his salary, even with close friends, in a country where he earns almost 40 times the average wage.\n","491":"Hong Kong-based robotics firm Hanson Robotics wants to create humanised robots that will understand people and work together with mankind to create a better future, according to a top executive.\u00a0\nDavid Hanson, founder and chief executive of Hanson Robotics, said at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in Hong Kong that fears of robots surpassing humans in intelligence, and turning against people could be circumvented by teaching the machines how to connect with people.\nWhile Hanson's comments are aspirational at this point, they underscore a goal that could potentially refute concerns about artificial intelligence going rogue, a notion raised by scientists like Stephen Hawking and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, with Hawking even stating that AI could end mankind.\nHanson has begged to differ.\n\"If we can make machines understand and have a relationship with us, then if they do become intelligent, they will ... work with us to create a better future,\" said Hanson during a panel discussion on Wednesday.\nIn the robotics industry, Hanson is known for creating realistic humanoid robots powered by artificial intelligence - his company has developed a lightweight polymer plastic called \"Frubber\" (a contraction of the words \"face\" and \"rubber\") that behaves similarly to human skin.\nHanson has built a walking robot based on the portrait of Albert Einstein, and Sophia - Hanson Robotic's more well-known robot, which can express around 60 different emotions and converse with people.\nIf we can make machines understand and have a relationship with us, then if they do become intelligent, they will ... work with us to create a better future\nDavid Hanson, Hanson Robotics\nHaving robots to be facially expressive was important for humans to communicate naturally with them, since experts estimate that about 70 per cent of human communication stems from non-verbal cues, said Hanson.\n\"We want [robots] to learn what it means to be human, to be able to read faces and express themselves in a natural way ... [we need an] AI framework that simulates life, so robots can learn from the world,\" he said.\nHanson Robotics is moving towards building a robot that can be compassionate and friendly towards people, to \"wire AI for greater good\".\nHe likened machines that are treated like \"indentured servants in some back room server farm crunching data for stock predictions\" to feral creatures, which would be difficult to control if they gain intelligence.\nHanson dismissed concerns that AI would deal a negative impact on people by taking away jobs, but advocated that automation will help businesses manage their resources better and generate more wealth globally.\n\"[Ultimately automation is about] balancing the resources so that companies are more profitable but people also get more resources and opportunities to be creative,\" he said.\n\"The problem with classic jobs today is that many people are not doing what they care about.

[Photo\/IC]\nStartups looking for funding to develop next-generation technology like artificial intelligence and robotics are increasingly likely to find it in China.\u00a0\nCompanies working on equipment to deliver parcels to the moon, robots to stock warehouse shelves, and computers capable of acquiring knowledge like a human are among more than 30 startups seeded by Comet Labs since its founding last year.\nThe venture capital firm, created by Chinese investment fund Legend Star, gave the media an introduction to its work this week. It provided only the briefest of glimpses into its investment portfolio, without disclosing further details on the seed companies, but it was enough to make clear the cutting-edge nature of their technology.\nLegend Star is owned by Hong Kong-listed Legend Holdings, which is also the parent company of Chinese PC maker Lenovo. Comet Labs not only provides funding for startups, but also helps find them clients.\nComet Labs Managing Director Saman Farid said the startups it has backed have managed to secure a combined 40 million U.S. dollars in follow-up funding rounds that have also drawn investors including Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator.\n\"The world has been carried forward by waves of technology, from digitization to the Internet, then mobile Internet and we believe the next wave will be artificial intelligence,\" said Farid.\nUntil recently, China had mostly been on the receiving end of venture capital from around the world as many of the country's top Internet firms, from Alibaba and Tencent to Uber competitor Didi and smartphone maker Xiaomi, received backing from overseas.\nBut the outbound investment made by Chinese firms like Comet Labs could signal a reverse in the flow of capital, as investors in China look out for entrepreneurs tinkering with what could eventually evolve into technology that redefines industries.\nEarlier this month, Zhongguancun Development Group, a state-backed investment firm based in Beijing's tech hub Zhongguancun, also set up a fund to raise 10 to 20 million yuan ($1.5 to $3 million) to incubate startups focused on smart manufacturing in Germany.\nIn June, a group of Chinese investors, including Baidu, CICC Alpha, China Everbright and IDG also participated in the $60 million financing round for US online cross-border payment startup Circle, which uses the block chain technology that many in the financial industry say has the potential to bring sweeping changes to the financial world.\nThis investment comes at a time when China's vast manufacturing sector is wobbling. Industrial production growth has been slowing consistently, sinking to 6 percent for the first half of 2016, compared with double-digit rates couples of years ago.\nRather than consumer-facing firms, much of China venture capital's outbound investment goes to startups working on technology to enhance businesses' operational efficiency and productivity, as such technology holds the promise of catapulting Chinese manufacturing to the higher end of the industrial value chain.\n\"A lot of traditional industries like agriculture, healthcare and construction have been little changed by the Internet and digitization, but they could look very different with technology like artificial intelligence and smart machines and these technologies will go beyond borders,\" Comet Labs' Farid said.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/22\/146883470715.jpg\nb083fe955aa118f660a901.jpg\n","495":"The Beijing municipal government is introducing new measures, including easing of visa policies and cash incentives of up to 1 million yuan (US$158,000) to attract top class global talent to work in the capital, as China competes with the US and other countries in artificial intelligence and life sciences.\u00a0\nThe local government will fast track qualified individuals' multiple entry visas valid for up to 10 years, offer permanent residency, also known as \"green card\", which allows holders to buy property, cars and access to local schools, according to a statement on the local government website on Thursday.\nPartners at venture capital and private equity firms and entrepreneurs are among those that Beijing wants to attract, with senior management and professionals employed by multinationals and top firms from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan also in the mix.\nChina scours the globe for talent to transform into world leader in artificial intelligence and big data\nThe cash incentives are subject to recruits fulfilling their contract obligations.\nChina's State Council laid out goals last July to build a US$150 billion domestic AI industry in the next few years, and to make the country an \"innovation centre for AI\" by 2030.\nKey to that ambition is finding enough people to staff and lead its research institutes and tech companies.\nWithin China, Beijing is one of several cities competing for both local and foreign talent. Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, is home to companies like internet giant Tencent Holdings, telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies and drone maker DJI.\nThe two cities are working to build a joint innovation park to attract more talent to the region, while a \"Greater Bay Area\" blueprint aims to build a mega economic and business hub by integrating Hong Kong and Macau with nine cities in neighbouring Guangdong province.\nEven so, China is suffering from a shortage of qualified people to staff its ambitions to become a leader in AI, part of a global mismatch as countries employ advanced computing sciences to drive the next stage of growth, according to a report by Tencent last year.\nChina's battle for top AI talent heats up as JD.com creates new research and development unit\nA trade tension between US and China could put a dampener on the free flow of skilled workers and overseas investments in areas such as intellectual property.\n\"The US has been one of the top destinations for Chinese foreign direct investment over the last five years,\" said Simon Baptist, global chief economist and managing director at The Economist Intelligence Unit Asia. \"This tells us that US firms have things that Chinese firms want, which do include things like intellectual property, skilled workers and market access, and the coming restrictions on FDI could be the most painful part for China.\"\nCopyright (c) 2018.

Based on the score, companies are divided into four categories.\n\nBaidu was rated among \"contenders\" along with companies such as Toyota, Jaguar Land Rover and Hyundai Motor. The Chinese company had moved up from the \"challengers\" section, leaving Tesla, Uber and Apple to the lowest-ranked category. The traditional automotive giants of General Motors, Volkswagen and Ford dominated the top tier, together with Google's Waymo self-driving unit.\n\nAs part of China's hand-picked champions for artificial intelligence, Baidu has been charged with developing autonomous driving. At the CES technology show in Las Vegas earlier this month, Baidu chief operating officer Lu Qi said that China was closing the gap with the US rapidly in AI, thanks to strong government support and the country's huge population size, which are key ingredients in promoting the development of the technology.\n\nThe results are a surprise given widespread perception that technology companies would upend traditional car manufacturers in the race to automate vehicles. Tesla, which captured popular imagination when it debuted its \"Autopilot\" function in October 2014, remains in the \"challengers\" category after parting ways with Mobileye in 2016 following a fatal crash involving one of its vehicles on the autopilot mode.\n\nTesla has \"struggled to reach the same level of functionality with its in-house developed system\" since ending its relationship with the Israeli self-driving technology company, Navigant said in its report.\n\nApple, Uber and Tesla did not immediately reply to emailed requests for comment. Baidu said it does not comment on rankings.\n\nAutonomous cars are widely regarded as the holy grail of artificial intelligence development because navigating in a real-world environment is difficult.\n\nThe only tech company in the \"leaders\" group is Waymo, which has partnered with the likes of Fiat-Chrysler, Lyft and Avis to help address its main weakness - the lack of experience in building, maintaining, and owning a fleet of vehicles.\n","505":"Zhang Quan left a career as a telecoms engineer to work in a  then-unknown branch of artificial intelligence called hierarchical network of concept (HNC). The goal of his team at the Institute of Acoustics is to teach a computer how to \"read\" books and absorb the knowledge. \n How does the HNC determine  whether a webpage contains undesirable content?  \u00a0\n Most of the mainstream content filtering programmes today rely on keywords. They block a page when certain words are found. It is a mechanical process. Quite often innocent pages become victims. Websites that attack \"porn video\", for instance, are blocked because they use a keyword.  HNC goes beyond keywords and makes a computer capable of understanding the context in which the keyword appears. It regards \"Porn videos are our enemy\" as safe because it knows that an enemy is bad. It can do so because it understands our natural language.\n How do you \"teach\" a computer Chinese?\n We teach computers like we would a child. We don't treat them as a tool or a machine that can only do what it is told. When we teach a computer human language, it is possible to give them feelings and emotions and the capability to independently analyse what they are told and generate creative feedback. This is not  science fiction. Treating computers like humans is the guiding philosophy of our team.\nWhen we teach it a language, we give the computer a chance to simulate how the brain works. Individual words are what children first learn to understand but unlike a child who needs years to build up a decent vocabulary, a computer can absorb millions of words in seconds. So the first thing we did was to compile a dictionary. The dictionary is similar to the ones that rest on our desktops but the difference is that our dictionary translates the natural language words, with each potentially having multiple meanings, into a string of abstract symbols that the computer can understand. Then we teach the computer how to understand a sentence. It's an extremely challenging process. Here is an example: in wo chi fan (I eat rice) chi means \"to eat\". Wo chi cha means \"I drink tea\" however.  A human brain can tell the different meaning of chi in an instant because it knows the difference between tea and rice and is capable of building a link between them. \nHNC enables a computer to \"think\" in the same way. We call it understanding when a computer can correctly determine the relationship between all the words in a sentence. In our experiments, the accuracy of HNC has reached up to 80 per cent.\nThe third stage, which is what we are working on right now, is teaching a computer how to find a theme in a paragraph.  In  future  we hope the computer can understand an entire article without human assistance. But it might take several more generations of research.\n Why did you choose artificial intelligence as a life-time career?\n My undergraduate and master's degrees are both in signal processing, a field light years away from what I am doing now. Most of my time then was spent on noise reduction for electric communications such as long-distance phone calls to make signals sharper and clearer. I didn't even have a chance to look into some of the most basic mechanisms of how a computer works.\nWhen I was about to graduate, I looked back upon what I had been doing in the previous few years and found that the field was really lacking the excitement of uncharted areas and there were simply too many people equipped with the same knowledge and skills. So I poked around and found that in the Acoustic Institute a very well-known professor called Huang Zengyang had just established a new discipline called HNC and needed a PhD student. With a wild imagination inspired by science fiction and movies about artificial intelligence, I entered the programme.\nAlmost immediately I found that most of the things I had supposed were wrong. I thought computers were powerful and smart, that all I needed to do was to give them a few guidelines and they would begin to act as rationally and sensitively as a human. But the truth was that they were incompetent, extremely incompetent, in terms of intelligence. When I submitted my PhD thesis, I found that I was more confused than I had been three years before. I thought about quitting but a voice at the back of my mind said that I could not leave with nothing but confusion. So I stayed on.\n Did you ever regret your decision?\n Over the next four years, from 1997 to 2000, our team struggled to survive. It was an entirely new discipline and we needed to start everything from scratch, such as compiling the dictionary, a rather sophisticated and yet labour-intensive job. It could not generate any economic benefits, because it was still at the stage of fundamental research, so when competing with other, more mature fields in applied science, we were often the loser.\nAlso, because the discipline was new, many established experts in artificial intelligence found it  difficult to understand.  It turned out to be a huge disadvantage when we submitted our papers to leading journals, as editors and peer reviewers would treat them with suspicion and require us to submit more supplementary materials than usual. \nThe situation has changed a lot since the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched a project to fund creative ideas and new disciplines. Now we are working for several national projects on artificial intelligence and rush to meet our deadlines every day.\n  What is your vision of HNC  in the future?\n HNC can provide a single platform for a computer to understand different languages. My dream machine is a single computer that can read all the books humans have ever written and absorb every bit of knowledge that has been accumulated in history. When you want to know about something all you have to do is to sit in front of it and speak naturally about what you are looking for. You don't need to be precise, you don't need to be complete and you don't even need to know exactly what you  are after. The computer can understand your needs better than you do because it knows more, much more than anyone else. This is the artificial intelligence that I am looking forward to.\nZhang Quan was speaking  to Stephen Chen\n","507":"\u00a0\n It may be all about dating and flirting for its subscribers but its creators say the really interesting question about a new virtual girlfriend computer program may be its potential to answer a fundamental question of artificial intelligence: can humans have a relationship with a machine?\n In November and January, Hong Kong-based Artificial Life will roll out a virtual girlfriend and boyfriend for users of 3G phones in what is billed as the world's first cyber-affair computer program.\n The virtual mates have likes, dislikes and mood swings, and can engage in conversations by responding to key words and contexts. High-resolution graphics will simulate realistic backgrounds in the office, home and public places.\u00a0\n \"It is usually very difficult to simulate smart, human-like responses and behaviour with machines and software,\" said Eberhard Schoneburg, chief executive officer of Artificial Life.\n \"But in certain limited applications and scenarios it is quite possible; we hope the Virtual Girlfriend will get us a step closer to simulate human behaviour in a believable and realistic manner that is enjoyable to the players. In our game we are using graphics and animations as well as voices. Therefore, the recipient has an even more human-like impression.\"\n Mr Schoneburg, a former computer science professor, referred to the new dating game as a version of the Turing Test, the cornerstone of artificial intelligence. The test is a game in which a human being and a computer are questioned by an interrogator who does not know which is which. Some theorists argue that if the interrogator cannot distinguish between them after some time, it would be reasonable to call the computer intelligent.\n \"Our Virtual Girlfriend is similar to the Turing Test,\" said Mr Schoneburg. \"The player communicates with a virtual character through his mobile phone, not exactly knowing who will respond to his chats ...  The player does not know whether the response he or she receives comes from a piece of software - or from one of our human employees. And this is part of the fun of our game.\" The virtual girlfriend is scheduled for commercial release in November in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Germany.\n University of Hong Kong philosophy professor Laurence Goldstein believed it was only a matter of time for programmers to develop completely believable \"worlds\" like the Hollywood blockbuster Matrix.\n \"But these programs raise interesting questions about illusion and reality, and also pose ethical questions about the morality of fooling people this way,\" he said.\n","509":"In a classic scene from science-fiction thriller i, Robot, mass-produced NS-5 humanoid robots churned out from the production line assert control over the human race after a self-evolving supercomputer governing their behaviour goes rogue.\nThe film is set in 2035, and while such prospects may sound far-fetched in 2017, alarm bells were set off recently when a Japanese insurance firm sacked 34 staff to make way for an artificial intelligence system.\nThe computer software, manufacturer IBM claims, is a cognitive technology that can \"think like a human\", and the company that adopted it aimed to achieve 30 per cent extra efficiency when calculating insurance payouts for clients.\nJapan has been a leading nation for embracing innovation and technologies, leaving its Asian neighbours - and perhaps even the world - in the dust.\u00a0\nBut Hong Kong can do just as well - if not better - says an academic who specialises in mechanical, aerospace, electronic and computer engineering.\nProfessor Michael Wang Yu from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said there had been a very strong sense of the need to build an innovation ecosystem.\n\"The [Hong Kong] government has been trying to demonstrate more mature technologies that could be helpful for some local companies ... I mean robotic technologies that have been tested out already and utilised somewhere else,\" he said.\nWang, founding director of the Robotics Institute at HKUST, said one of the university's five strategic areas was to boost research in robotics and automation technologies.\nComprising students and academics from various fields of engineering, the institute boasts three pillars of research, education and entrepreneurship.\n\"We want students in our community to be interested in taking up new ideas and technologies, and grow them into businesses,\" he said.\nHe gave the example of drone manufacturer DJI, a Shenzhen-based firm founded by a HKUST alumnus and a former member of the Automation Technology Centre, the predecessor of the Robotics Institute.\nLike DJI, the professor believed, a lot of start-ups were \"moving into new fields where no one had been before\".\n\"DJI figured out the right technology, figured out the need for the people, made a product and opened up a market - that's very similar to [Apple's] iPhone,\" he said. \"That's where Hong Kong can also prosper.\"\nHarry Shum, executive vice-president of artificial intelligence and research group at Microsoft, who gave a talk recently at HKUST, said the city had huge potential to develop artificial intelligence in the medical and transportation fields.\n\"The city's dense population and environment ... [coupled with] advances in computing power means there is a lot of room to grow,\" he said.\nShum, who specialises in speech and vision recognition research, said Hong Kong's advantage was its world-class universities, which nurture the \"brightest students\", while having China to provide a wealth of opportunities to test out their ideas.\nIn robotics development, he said the relatively smaller sizes of Hong Kong's homes provided a good test bed to conduct research on \"home care\" robots, which assist with daily chores and household duties.\n\"AI and robotics are definitely going to be the future,\" he confidently predicted.\nPrepare for robotics, AI to worsen the backlash of globalisation\nWhile the city had the research capabilities and infrastructure, the biggest problem was funding, according to Wang and many of his fellow researchers.\nRealising the need to catch up with its regional counterparts, the Hong Kong government set aside HK$2 billion in the policy address last year to set up an innovation and technology venture fund.\nTo be rolled out in the coming months, the initiative is aimed at encouraging the development of high technology and diversifying the city's economy, which is overwhelmingly inclined towards finance, tourism and logistics.\nWang said over the years, gross expenditure on research and development in the city contributed less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product, lagging far behind its regional counterparts.\nAccording to the Innovation and Technology Bureau, HK$15.6 billion was spent in the area in 2013, representing 0.73 per cent of GDP.\nTo put that figure into perspective, data compiled by the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation suggested South Korea derived 4.29 per cent of its GDP from research and development in the same year, the most in the world.\nJapan came third with 3.58 per cent, while both Singapore and China attributed 2 per cent of its economy to research and development.\nHenry Hu, who co-invented a coffee vending machine featuring a robotic arm and advance online ordering system, said one of the biggest challenges for them was getting the funds to build a prototype.\nTo help achieve their goal, they applied for the incubation programme at Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, a non-profit body set up by the government.\n\"The application process was very straightforward and we managed to get extremely cost-friendly office space at HKSTP. Being able to recruit skilled local engineers quickly and work out of HKSTP at nearly no cost was very helpful in getting us started,\" said Hu, who is now chief executive officer of his start-up, Cafe X.\nThe machine involves customers ordering their caffeine fix over the phone, with the option of scheduling a pick-up time to save queuing.\nOnce there, the customer enters a code, and the robotic arm goes to work by pushing buttons and handing over the cup, all without manual assistance. One machine is currently operating at a busy concourse inside the HKSTP.\nWhile HKSTP provided the infrastructure and networking opportunities, they still needed money to fund the project.\n\"CoCoon Ignite Ventures from Hong Kong made a bet on us very early on and so far it has turned out to be a good investment for them. I really commend their unconventional appetite for risk,\" Hu said.\nSurge in Hong Kong start-ups as more young people shun safe career paths\nThe company has since closed a round of equity financing from Silicon Valley institutional investors after demonstrating its robotic cafe technology at the Launch Festival in San Francisco last year and winning best overall start-up.\nWhile Hu and many of his peers continue to work out novel solutions and drive innovation, traditional industries are also keen to adopt technology and make work easier and more efficient.\nEngineering firm Gammon Construction, which employs more than 8,000 people with an annual turnover exceeding HK$19.5 billion, has long faced a shortage of manpower.\nTo lure talent into the industry and relieve the workload of employees, the company ordered two sets of \"zero-gravity arms\" from the US.\nThe mechanical devices, which can operate without power, allow workers to operate machinery without shouldering their weight, reducing the strain and fatigue caused by repetitive tasks such as drilling and tiling.\nThe arms have been deployed at the construction site of the Tseung Kwan O Data Centre since September, with mostly positive feedback.\nChina badly needs robots to protect its economy from a shrinking labour force, report reveals\nAt the same time, two sets of exoskeletons were bought from Japan to help workers carry heavy loads.\nInnovation manager Andy Wong revealed the procurements cost around HK$400,000 and they would study if the trial scheme was to be expanded by gauging workers' feedback, efficiency and sustainability.\nHuman resources chief Edmond Lai said the firm faced a 5.4 per cent shortage of workers, rising to 21.8 per cent for electrical and mechanical technicians.\nThe company admitted it would continue to streamline processes and reduce reliance on manpower, such as introducing modular fabrication, the use of pre-cast parts shipped from factories for faster assembly at construction sites.\nThe [robotic arms] only help us navigate areas hard to reach ... we're still in total control\nTimmy Au Wing-kuk, Queen Mary Hospital\nRobotic arms are even saving lives. Queen Mary Hospital's Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery has successfully used the technology to conduct minimally invasive heart operations on 14 patients, with benefits of smaller incisions, reduced chances of complications and faster healing times.\nAsked if there were fears that the machine would replace surgeons one day, the department's chief of service, Timmy Au Wing-kuk, laughed off the idea, pointing out the robotic arm had to be operated by trained doctors.\n\"The [robotic arms] only help us navigate areas hard to reach by human hands, but other than that we're still in total control of the procedure - even though the machine was operated in another room,\" he said.\nWhile companies and institutions continued to embrace technology to streamline manpower, Wang said from a research point of view, automation was completely different to robotics.\nRobotics, he said, was categorised as a system that made autonomous decisions with self-programming capabilities.\nFactory production lines all employed machines, but the procedures were repetitive and did not involve any intelligence, the professor pointed out.\nHe gave the example of Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which plans to fully automate its factories in mainland China by replacing human workers with robots in a three-phase scheme.\nThe Post reported last year that a Foxconn plant in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, had already replaced 60,000 workers with robots.\nAsked why most postgraduate students in his department came from mainland China with few local faces in research labs, Wang gave a coy answer. \"This is a much harder subject that is not for everyone.\"\nWhen pressed for a more concrete explanation, he said he believed the limited opportunities in Hong Kong deterred many teenagers from studying engineering, and those who did had few incentives to stay on after completing their studies.\n\"China is entering the robotics industry aggressively. There is potential for Hong Kong companies to join the trend,\" he said.\nCopyright (c) 2017. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

China is the world's largest agricultural producer, but it faces a severe shortage of arable land as a result of urbanization, industrialization and climate change, according to the China National Grain and Oils Information Center.\nScientists to discuss trends in artificial intelligence\nThe annual meeting of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology will be held in Changchun, Jilin province, from Saturday to Monday. Delegates will discuss the latest trends in fields including artificial intelligence, air pollution control and traditional Chinese medicine.\nHangzhou to host qualifying round of world esports event\nThe Asian qualifying competition for the second World Electronic Sports Games will be held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Saturday and Sunday. The event is an international esports tournament. China has become a key esports market with 50.46 billion yuan ($7.3 billion) generated in revenues in the sector last year, up by 35 percent from 2015, according to gaming research institution Gamma Data Corp.\n(China Daily 06\/23\/2017 page2)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/51\/149818673646.jpg\n00221917e13e1ab6bcd71e.jpg\n","514":"At the busy Chinese border point of Gongbei Port, fewer than a dozen custom officers have the mammoth task of picking out the smugglers and tax dodgers from the 400,000 travellers to and from Macau each day.\nThese officers are now aided by a powerful facial recognition system built by Shanghai-based start-up Yitu Technology, whose software is also used by banks to verify ATM transactions. Surveillance cameras at Gongbei Port capture the images of every traveller, matching and cross-referencing them with national databases. Those who cross over to Macau and back multiple times a day - a key attribute of smugglers - are flagged for closer attention.\nThree seconds is all it takes to identify someone from the 1.4 billion faces stored in China's national databases, and public security agencies have been the major source of demand for Yitu's technology so far, according to Lin Chenxi, one of Yitu's co-founders and responsible for product research and development.\u00a0\nShanghai's old laneways get facial recognition, smart fire alarms in tie-up with iPhone maker Foxconn\nThat demand is driven by the need to secure key buildings, schools, hospitals and other public institutions, Lin said. The company has set its sights on exporting its technology overseas, to countries in Africa and Europe, where governments are grappling with the threat of terrorism, he said.\n\"Someday, AI technology will be just like the internet, existing everywhere in our daily lives,\" Lin said in an interview in Shanghai this month. \"There's broader potential for the application of AI-based facial recognition beyond its current usage in public security, finance and medicine.''\nCompanies like Yitu are benefiting from a state-backed push into developing artificial intelligence, or AI. In July, China's State Council laid out goals to build a domestic artificial intelligence industry worth nearly US$150 billion in the next few years, and to make the country an \"innovation centre for AI\" by 2030. Chinese President Xi Jinping reinforced that goal in his speech at the Communist Party's once-in-five years conclave, naming advanced technologies including the internet, big data and AI as crucial tools to help build China into a \"strong country with advanced manufacturing.\"\nApple's embrace of facial recognition technology in new iPhone unsettles privacy activists\nMoney has been pouring into the field even before the government anointment, with total investment in Chinese AI firms reaching US$2.76 billion last year, compared to US$20.7 billion raised in the US in the same year, according to data from China's Wuzhen Institute.\nTo ensure a coordinated approach, China's science and technology ministry this month named Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as well as speech intelligence specialist iFlyTek as the first four members of an \"AI national team\", charged with leading development in their respective fields.\nSomeday, AI technology will be just like the internet, existing everywhere in our daily lives\nLin Chenxi, Yitu co-founder\nAnalysts said Chinese companies specialising in computer vision have traditionally focused on the public security and finance industries, creating intense competition with many me-too products.\n\"First-tier players in facial recognition, including Yitu, are expected to explore more business opportunities outside the public security sector where they are currently concentrated with,\" said Li Jingwang, an analyst with Itjuzi, a Beijing-based research firm.\nYitu's Lin, who graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2005, was part of the university team that won the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC) team in 2002, the first Asian team to win what is widely considered the \"Olympics of programming\" competitions.\nYitu, which Lin cofounded with CEO Zhu Long in 2012, won first place in several segments in facial-recognition competitions conducted by US agencies. The company's AI solutions are deployed on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform. In May, Hillhouse Capital Group led a 380 million yuan (US$57 million) round of financing for Yitu.\nIts facial recognition technology is used by several banks in China, including China Merchants Bank, to enable cash withdrawals without a bank card at more than 1,500 outlets across the country. The software is sensitive enough to be able to distinguish between a real human face and a photo placed in front of the camera, according to Yitu, which said no cases of fraud or mistaken identity have been recorded since the function was introduced late last year.\nChina to build giant facial recognition database to identify any citizen within seconds\nTo expand overseas, Yitu has set up offices in a number of African countries, including South Africa, to work with local governments on applying its technology to public security. The company is also expanding into the UK and other European countries, where a series of terrorist attacks have raised the demand for the latest in surveillance and security technology, Lin said.\nWhile Yitu will provide the technology to overseas users, the company itself will not retain any personal data, Lin said. The company will set up a R&D laboratory in Singapore and use it as a launch pad to expand into the region, it said.\nLin said the next step for Yitu is to ensure that its facial recognition software can be applied to other racial groups.\nFor Yitu to have a place on the global stage, it must own \"world-class algorithms,\" Lin said. \"Simply put, if a Chinese AI company is only able to identify Chinese faces, its technology won't be able to be used worldwide.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Shenzhen is already home to companies like internet giant Tencent, telecoms manufacturer Huawei and drone maker DJI.\n\nHong Kong and Shenzhen are working to build a joint innovation park to attract more talent to the region, while a \"Greater Bay Area\" plan aims to build a huge economic and business hub by integrating Hong Kong, Macau and nine mainland cities.\n\nHowever, China does not have enough qualified people to meet its ambitious goals, part of a global mismatch of places and professionals as countries employ advanced computing sciences to drive their next stage of growth, according to a report by Tencent last year.\n\nTrade tensions between the United States and China are also likely to put a damper on the \u00adglobal free flow of skilled professionals and investment.\n\n\"The US has been one of the top destinations for Chinese foreign direct investment over the last five years,\" said Simon \u00adBaptist, global chief economist and managing director at The Economist Intelligence Unit Asia.\n\n\"This tells us that US firms have things that Chinese firms want, which do include things like intellectual property, skilled workers and market access, and the coming restrictions on foreign investment could be the most painful part for China.\"\n","517":"The Chengdu city government announced at a conference on Nov 9 that it will develop the new economy as a strategic driving force for local growth, to build a modern economic system. Since then, a group of related projects have started to gather in the capital of Sichuan province.\nTwo weeks after the conference, nine projects were signed at the Chengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone, with a total investment of 18.86 billion yuan ($2.85 billion). They cover diverse fields, including new retail, big data, artificial intelligence and healthcare.\u00a0\nAt the signing ceremony on Nov 23, Guoxiaomei, a startup focusing on building self-service convenience stores for companies, said it will invest 5 billion yuan to construct its national headquarters and an industrial center at the zone.\nThe construction project also includes an operations center, a customer service center, artificial intelligence labs, smart hardware and logistics, as well as 100,000 square meters of intelligent warehouse management and supply chain systems.\nLess than six months after its establishment, Guoxiaomei has secured over 400 million yuan of financing from several top venture capital firms, such as Alibaba and IDG Capital. With about 200 employees, the company has provided services to more than 1,500 companies nationwide.\nCainiao Network Technology, the logistics arm of Alibaba, plans to invest 3 billion yuan to build a regional operations center to deal with businesses in western and southern China.\nLi Jun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, announced the opening of a smart, internet-connected cars innovation center at the zone, with a total investment of 100 million yuan. It aims to build a new auto industry system highlighting the interaction among the drivers, the cars and the internet.\nWith its ideal environment for developing the new economy, Chengdu has been fostering a batch of potential unicorn companies - startups with a more than $1 billion market value.\nThe city is currently home to 31 potential unicorns. They cover nine industries such as healthcare, culture and entertainment, big data and new media, according to Greatwall Strategy Consultants.\nXgimi Technology, a company focusing on design, research and production of no-screen projector televisions, is one of them. Statistics from Beijing-based research firm Analysys showed that Xgimi ranked No 1 in 2015 in China's intelligent projection markets, with a 51.4 percent market share.\nZhong Bo, founder and CEO of the company, said Xgimi plans to build an international display technology research center and a precision optical device manufacturing center by working with its global leading partners.\nIdealsee Technology, a virtual reality products company, moved its production plant from Shenzhen to Chengdu on Nov 2, with its 10 newly developed VR devices rolling off the production line that day at Aplus Labs, a business incubator in the city.\nSince 2012, Idealsee has grown from a small firm of several employees into a company with about 200 staff members.\nLi Xinyu, vice-president of the company, said he chose Chengdu because the city has a favorable business climate and can offer many high-quality employees due to its rich educational resources.\n\"The city government is willing to support companies to explore unknown and emerging fields, which is very valuable for startups,\" Li said.\nBy 2020, Chengdu plans to foster more than 100,000 new economy companies, including seven unicorns and 60 potential unicorns.\nhaonan@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 12\/08\/2017 page7)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/42\/151269499091.jpg\n00221917e13e1b9421a028.jpg\n","518":"It may not mean much for people outside the tech sector, but for insiders, it's a glimpse of the big picture envisaged by the mainland's internet giants. And they're seeing vast potential in online health care, artificial intelligence, and even the possibility of brainwave communication.\u00a0\nTencent is building an \"internet hospital\", its CEO Pony Ma Huateng told the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang (  ) province, yesterday.\n\"There are more and more opportunities for the internet to connect with health care,\" Ma said in a speech at the mainland's biggest internet event. The hospital, set up in Wuzhen, would provide long-distance diagnoses and medicine delivery.\nBaidu CEO Robin Li Yanhong said big data could help make people healthier by examining which medical practices worked as well as which human genes were causing diseases. Health tips could be tested out online by linking the community of people practising them, he said.\nThe next big thing, according to Li, was artificial intelligence, as people's daily devices became smarter thanks to an increased computing ability.\n\"What used to be impossible will become possible,\" he said. \"AI will replace most of people's simple intelligent work ... AI will have a greater impact than the industrial revolution on humanity.\"\nBaidu is developing its driverless-car system, which Li demonstrated to President Xi Jinping (   ) at the conference.\n\"It has laser radar as its eyes and a computer as its brain. It is more of an intelligent machine than a car,\" Li said.\nTencent's Ma believes that the new way in which humans and their machines are interacting will revolutionise the tech industry.\nMa said virtual and augmented reality might become a new way of interaction. Retina projectors on glasses might replace computer screens and even brainwave communication was a possibility, he said.\nChinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's CEO Lei Jun also saw potential in virtual reality. The VR sector, though still in its early stages, would likely mature in the next three to five years, he said.\nLei was also optimistic about the robotics industry.\nXiaomi entered the robotics market when it invested in mainland robotics firm Ninebot, which produces personal transport devices such as a self-balancing scooter dubbed the Ninebot Mini.\nIn April, Ninebot acquired American firm Segway, which invented the eponymous two-wheeled motorised personal vehicle that failed to go mainstream in consumer markets.\nNokia board member Risto Siilasmaa said in a panel at the internet conference yesterday that digital health and virtual reality were the technologies that would transform the future.\n\"Premier Li Keqiang (   ) has been advocating new growth opportunities, and Nokia will be here to work hand in hand with China [to achieve these],\" he said.\nSiilasmaa said the internet had first to become ubiquitous and dependable enough to ensure interconnectedness no matter users' locations before technologies such as remote medical treatment and autonomous vehicles could be used reliably in real-time.\n","519":"A personal assistant should no longer be a privilege for only the rich or the powerful\uff0dthat is the philosophy behind Wang Guanchun's creation, an artificial\u00a0intelligence-based Chinese-language app called Zhuli Laiye.\nA personal assistant should no longer be a privilege for only the rich or the powerful\uff0dthat is the philosophy behind Wang Guanchun's creation, an artificial\u00a0intelligence-based Chinese-language app called Zhuli Laiye (Laiye in short, meaning 'Here comes the assistant'.)\nWith a few taps on the phone, users can text or speak out instructions to get everything from coffees to flowers delivered on demand and for free.\u00a0\nA startup from Microsoft's incubator program Accelerator, Laiye received series-A funding last year with the tech giant itself leading the investors. Among all of the tech giant's graduate programs, Laiye is the first Chinese startup to receive Microsoft's investment.\nLaiye is meant to be a dream assistant: it is professional, prompt and receptive to criticism, said Wang, a Princeton graduate of machine learning, who has worked with Baidu on intelligent search.\nThree emerging trends propelled Wang to set up his own business in July 2015: the deepening of online-to-offline or O2O integration of retailers; the predominant role of messaging apps in smartphones; and the rapid advances in artificial\u00a0intelligence-based technologies.\n\"Rescheduling meetings back and forth and optimizing for attributes like timing and location\uff0dnobody likes that part of his or her job,\" said Wang. \"What we do is to enable users to make a smooth conversation with the virtual assistant and let it handle your tasks, without realizing that you are actually talking to an algorithm the whole time.\"\nLaiye first debuted a basic service via WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging app in China, followed by its own app. Later, it launched a premium version that caters specifically to larger and more complicated requests, and charges a monthly fee of 198 yuan ($28.6).\nFor instance, a regular user can order a cup of sugar-free cappuccino, pay online, and wait the drink to be delivered in an hour. Those who sign up for the VIP service are entitled to more tailored-made services, from booking flight tickets to fetching urgent documents.\nIn the past 18 months, it has registered over 2 million users. Over 90 percent of the interactions are AI-enabled. Only when a major challenge is detected by the app, the back-end support staff step in.\n\"It almost feels like having a hotel concierge around from 7 am to 10 pm, and it acts as a full-time employee that you don't have to pay full time,\" Wang said.\nAI powers most apps that function as virtual assistants. For example, AI will take into account a client's location and tell the assistant what service should be used to complete the task.\nAI technology also enables machine or app learning\uff0dthat is, over time, it will learn from the user's habits by analyzing frequent tasks, and patterns in them. For instance, the app would remember Wang's preference for aisle seats when booking flight tickets, so he doesn't need to specify that requirement again and again.\nFor Laiye, revenue comes mainly from three sources: VIP membership fees, commission fees from merchants, and the sales of technologies to industries that want to adopt AI-enabled services to bolster business.\n\"For instance, we are seeing this growing trend of online skincare vendors using online beauty advisors to give tips to potential buyers. That's something we'll probably dig deeper into,\" he said.\n","520":"Robotics and artificial intelligence are retooling the workplace faster than we can make sense of it.\nWhat should we do, for instance, with the taxi drivers and long-haul truckers who could see their livelihoods evaporate with the evolution of self-driving vehicles?\nResearchers say not only is the world changing at breakneck speed, but that sociologists and economists can't keep up with what the fallout will mean for the workplace.\u00a0\n\"Policymakers are flying blind into what has been called the fourth industrial revolution or the second machine age,\" wrote Tom Mitchell and Erik Brynjolfsson in an essay in the journal Nature in April. \"There is a remarkable lack of data available on basic questions, such as: What is the scope and rate of change of the key technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI)? Which technologies are already eliminating, augmenting or transforming which types of jobs? What new work opportunities are emerging, and which policy options might create jobs in this context?\n\"At best,\" the authors continue, \"this paucity of information will lead to missed opportunities. At worst, it could be disastrous. If we want to understand, prepare for and guide the unpredictable impacts of advancing technology, we must radically reinvent our ability to observe and track these changes and their drivers.\"\nThey note that industrial productivity has climbed while, since 1999, wages for the bottom 50 percent of earners have stagnated.\nAutomated vehicles show the impacts of technology in the possibly near future. But the present shows that clerical workers - people whose tasks can be dramatically streamlined or eliminated by old-fashioned computer word processors - have already begun to see their jobs disappear.\nIn 1990, roughly 26 percent of the workforce was devoted to clerical work. Today, those jobs represent barely 20 percent of the workforce.\nTo track what's happening and plot strategies to find useful work for people losing their jobs to automation, Mitchell and Brynjolfsson say, society needs to deploy new measurements to understand the trends.\n\"The irony of our information age is that despite the flood of online data, decision-makers all too often lack timely, relevant information,\" they wrote.\nThe researchers suggest government borrow from tech companies by experimenting with A\/B testing to lead people to their next jobs.\n\"The best policy for retraining displaced workers could be decided after trialling several different policies for workers within one region,\" they wrote. \"The policies' different impacts on employment could be observed for a year before moving forward with the one that produces the greatest re-employment. Authorities could continue to experiment to accommodate future changes.\"\nTheir essay was published in conjunction with a study for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine called, Information Technology and the US Workforce: Where Are We and Where Do We Go From Here?\nIn that study, the authors offer reason both for optimism and worry about the hard-to-fathom ways artificial intelligence and other technological advances might reshape the world of work.\n\"Advances in IT and automation will present opportunities to boost America's overall income and wealth, improve healthcare, shorten the workweek, provide more job flexibility, enhance educational opportunities, develop new goods and services, and increase product safety and reliability,\" the study says. \"These same advances could also lead to growing inequality and decreased job stability, increasing demands on workers to change jobs, or major changes in business organization. More broadly, these technologies have important implications, both intended and unintended, in areas from education and social relationships to privacy, security, and even democracy.\"\nTribune News

Tribune News Service\n(China Daily 05\/10\/2017 page20)\n","521":"Many private and public organisations in Hong Kong continue to lag in cybersecurity, raising the spectre of potential new breaches as advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and the so-called internet-of-things become mainstream applications in the city, a panel of experts told a forum held by the South China Morning Post on Friday.\u00a0\n\"It's already 2017, we need to wake up!\" said Michael Gazeley, the managing director at international managed security services provider Network Box in Kowloon, during the latest edition of the Redefining Hong Kong Debate Series.\nHis concern was echoed by the three other panel members in their discussion on whether businesses in the city should put greater priority in cybersecurity amid calls for increased convenience and privacy in various industries.\nSteven Lee Kun-tai, the founder and chief executive at online lending service provider MoneySQ.com, said financial technology outfits like his company, which use artificial intelligence to better know and serve customers, \"must strike a delicate balancing act to achieve efficiency in operations, while protecting user data\".\nHong Kong watchdog to tighten cybersecurity at brokers after hackers steal HK$110m over 18 months\nTed Egan, the vice-president for Asia-Pacific at security technology company ThreatMetrix, and Micky Lo, the chief technology risk officer for Asia-Pacific at The Bank of New York Mellon, both pointed out that educating senior management at organisations on cybersecurity must intensify.\nThat way, these decision makers can pursue strategies that can establish trusted identities and behaviour online, or offline, to help reduce data breaches at their specific organisations and the world in general.\n\"We are now all connected and most of our information are out there on the internet,\" Egan said.\nLo indicated that regulation on protecting digital information in the financial services sector has progressed over the years, but cautioned that cybersecurity compliance and related initiatives do not exist in other industries.\nHong Kong faces second-highest risk of cybersecurity breaches in Asia, report finds\nIn Hong Kong, weak security, complacency and possible hubris in the face of external and internal threats was exemplified by the recent theft of two laptop computers containing the personal information of 3.7 million Hong Kong voters, according to Gazeley.\nThe Registration and Electoral Office reported the two laptops were stolen from a locked room at the AsiaWorld-Expo in Lantau, but assured that the data on those laptops were encrypted.\nGazeley said that was no comfort to the voters whose addresses, mobile phone and ID card numbers have been compromised.\nHe said there are businesses in Hong Kong which say they are active on cybersecurity, but have balked at spending money for services \"which only cost as much as what they pay their cleaning lady each month\".\nRegulators have stepped in when necessary. The Securities and Futures Commission pursued a cybersecurity review of brokers in October after HK$126 million of unauthorised trades were reported in first three quarters of last year.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

After listening to the patients' symptoms, the robot can offer guidance on which medical departments patients should visit for treatment.\nConsultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers forecast that AI-related industries will boost China's GDP by as much as 26 percent by 2030.\nZong Xiao, vice-president of HIT Robot Group, a major robot manufacturer in China, said the company has established an AI research and development institute in Zhejiang province to explore how to combine the cutting-edge technology with its mechanical prowess.\n\"AI to robots is what operating systems are to personal computers. This is an area into which we will pour huge resources in the future,\" Zong said.\nHIT Robot Group was established in December 2014 with funding from the provincial government and the Harbin Institute of Technology, an elite Chinese university that has conducted years of cutting-edge research on robotics. The university was the manufacturer of China's first space robots and lunar vehicle.\nZong said the company has also established a venture capital fund to invest in promising AI startups in the United States, without disclosing the size of the fund. Two years ago, it set up two offices in Silicon Valley and Washington DC to help access the latest AI trends and the industry's best talents.\nIn June, China set up its first artificial intelligence alliance in a move to expand the industry at a rapid pace. Led by the China Center for Information Industry Development, tech giants such as iFlytek, JD.com Inc, and Ecovacs Robotics Co teamed up to form the non-profit organization.\nZhang Boxu, director of Beijing Municipal Commission of Economy and Information Technology, said the key battlefield for robotics is shifting from hardware competition to software.\n\"There is a growing demand for tailormade, internet-connected robots.

Some practitioners in the AI industry and are paid salaries that are unfairly high,\" said Wang Xiaochuan, chief executive officer of Chinese internet company Sogou. \"Investors expect too high a return on their investments, and the valuations of China's AI enterprises are much more expensive than those in the US.\"\nIn terms of investment in AI enterprises, China was in second place in 2016 on US$2.6 billion, followed by the UK on US$800 million, according to data from Chinese think tank WuZhen Institute. The US topped the list on US$17.9 billion.\u00a0\n\"The amount being invested in AI in Asia is growing by the day,\" said KPMG partner Egidio Zarrella. \"2017 will be the year investors will look at AI and say, 'if you're not investing in it, you're missing the boat'.\"\nInvestors expect too high a return on their investments, and the valuations of China's AI enterprises are much more expensive than those in the US\nWang Xiaochuan, Sogou\nThe vast amounts of capital and talent flooding into AI industries in China is not without good reason. Artificial\u00a0intelligence is poised to transform almost every aspect of people's lives, even though it is currently somewhat limited in scope, generally working on repetitive tasks based on big data and complex calculation.\n\"From an economic standpoint, I believe AI will replace human beings, including managerial and technical jobs, as well as manual labour jobs. It is almost unavoidable,\" said Ben Goertzel, chief scientist at Hanson Robotics, a company that claims it is developing the worlds' most human-like robots.\nSogou's Wang echoed this view, saying that AI has numerous critical roles to play in business.\n\"For example, it is bound to help with medical breakthroughs,\" he said. \"Use of AI technology in finance enables robot advice to be reliable and reduces labour costs in finance management.\"\nJP Morgan's COIN program does in seconds what consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers, according to a recent Bloomberg report.\n\"Education will also be one of the major potential beneficiaries from AI technology, which could observe your learning habits and provide smart advice,\" said Zhang Shoucheng, a physics professor at Stanford University.\nI believe AI will replace human beings, including managerial and technical jobs, as well as manual labour jobs.

The country's internet giants are racing to ramp up their efforts in the artificial\u00a0intelligence field too.\nAlibaba, the country's largest e-commerce company and owner of the South China Morning Post, announced a new suite of AI products last year which includes everything from audio transcription to financial risk analysis. Meanwhile Tencent, the operator of China's largest social network, has assembled more than 250 people for its AI Lab to research and develop areas such as machine learning, computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing.\nAnd China's biggest search engine, Baidu, hired former Microsoft executive Lu Qi as part of its plan to become a \"global leader in AI\". However, its chief scientist Andrew Ng , the core driver of its AI development, announced last week that he was stepping down. Zhang Yaqin, Baidu's president, said: \"The movement of talent is common in the market and it is pity that Ng left but lucky that Lu joined us.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Watson hasn't passed such a licensing exam in the United States,\" said Liu Qingfeng, the chairman of iFlyTek, which is headquartered in central China's Anhui province.\nThe robot, called the iFlyTek Smart Doctor Assistant, achieved a score of 456, higher than the mark of 360 required to pass the Clinical Practitioner Examination.\nAfter showing AI's power in the exam, Liu said the company was going to use the technology, which allows machines to talk and even think like humans, to \"empower the world\" by starting to change the education, medical care and law industries.\nChina scours the globe for talent to transform into world leader in artificial intelligence and big data\n\"Rather than replacing doctors, AI is able to help doctors better serve patients. By studying the medical cases and diagnosis skills of top doctors in top hospitals in megacities in China, our doctor AI can serve as an assistant to help doctors in remote areas in the country,\" he said.\nBuilding its business empire upon speech-recognition technology, iFlyTek is betting big on AI to change more industries amid China's national push on such technology.\nChina has made the development of AI a national strategy. The country's State Council issued a three-step road map in July with the goal of leapfrogging the US as the global leader in AI by 2030.\nLiu said the size of China's population will help the country achieve its goal on time as the huge Chinese market has provided it with a good test lab for training and testing AI technologies.\nComputer software sales and education contributed about a third each to the company's sales last year, with voice-recognition accounting for about 11 per cent.\niFlyTek, which counts China Mobile as its largest shareholder, has seen its shares more than double this year in Shenzhen, outpacing the 3 per cent gain in the Shenzhen Composite Index.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

The move comes one month after Chinese President Xi Jinping's opening speech at the 19th party congress which called for deeper integration between the real economy and advanced technologies, including internet, big data and AI.\nChina's ruling Communist Party released a three-step road map in July with the goal of making the country a global leader in the technology by 2030.\nWorld dominance in three steps: China sets out road map to lead in artificial intelligence by 2030\n\"It is the first time some of the country's biggest companies have been named in such a strategy,\" Wang said, adding that the government's blessing could give Baidu a leg-up when it came to cooperating with carmakers on self driving vehicles, and provide Tencent with wider access to hospital data.\nHowever, he noted that while national endorsement can accelerate the AI projects of these companies, \"it could impact market vitality, posing a challenge to industry latecomers\".\nIn comparison, the US and European countries foster industry growth through governmental research funding and legislation but would never elevate individual companies like Google to lead national platforms, he said.\nTencent joins the fray with Baidu in AI apps for self-driving cars\nJapan, which is also keen to develop AI, said in August it would invest billions of yen to fund next-generation semiconductors and other technologies critical to AI development. But the funding is going to start-up companies and researchers, enabling them to devise new technologies and develop world-class AI experts.\nWhile some question the strategy of naming national champions, Yu Kai, the founder of start-up Horizon Robotics and former head of the Baidu Institute of Deep Learning, said the four Chinese companies are only responsible for building the open platforms. \"The technologies and resources of the platforms will be open to everyone, which will benefit the entire industry. AI start-ups still have their chance,\" said Yu, who took part in the ministry meeting last week as a member of China's newly established AI strategy consultancy committee.\nWill this robot be the next Tencent in the era of artificial intelligence?\nHu Yu, executive president of iFlyTek, said in a statement that the company will use open innovative platform to help China become a world-leading player in voice intelligence and other applications of artificial intelligence.\nNew York-listed Alibaba, which owns the Post, announced in October that it would invest US$15 billion over the next three years in \"cutting-edge technologies\", including AI, through its global research effort called Discovery, Adventure, Momentum and Outlook (Damo) Academy. The company has already used AI technology to crack down on fake products sold online and to improve the e-commerce shopping experience through AI-enabled digital assistants.\nTencent is first Asian company to top US$500 billion in value\nBaidu, which has staked its future on transforming into an AI-driven business, is working to bring autonomous driving cars to China's road before the end of 2018.\nIn May Shenzhen-based Tencent set up an AI research lab in Seattle, in the US state of Washington, led by former Microsoft scientist Yu Dong.

It is part of the production process for a \"healing potion\" being consumed by millions of patients in China, according to the government.\n\nThere are many cockroach breeding facilities in the country, where the insect is use as an ingredient in medicine or as a source of protein for livestock feed. But no other facility can match the \u00adproductivity of the farm in the\u00adcity of Xichang, in southwestern Sichuan province.\n\nNearly 28,000 full-sized cockroaches per square foot were being produced there annually, the Sichuan government said in a report submitted to Beijing early this year.\u00a0\n\nIt is the first time in history so many cockroaches have been confined and bred in one space.\n\nThe facility achieved its unrivalled efficiency partly by being controlled by a \"smart manufacturing\" system powered by\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, according to the report.\n\nThe system constantly collects and analyses more than 80 categories of \"big data\", including humidity, temperature, food supply and consumption. It monitors changes such as genetic mutations and how these affect the growing rates of cockroaches.\n\nDr Zhang Wei, former assistant researcher at Zhejiang University who was involved in the development of the system, told the Post: \"It has used some unique solutions to address some unique issues.\"\n\nThe farm is operated by the Gooddoctor Pharmaceutical Group in Chengdu, Sichuan, which confirmed the validity of the government document but could not answer the\u00a0Post's queries because the matter involved trade secrets.\n\nAccording to a 2011 report by government newspaper\u00a0Guangming Daily, a visitor must change into a sanitised working suit to avoid bringing in pollutants or pathogens. \"There were very few human beings in the facility,\" the article stated.\n\n\"Whenever flashlights swept, the cockroaches fled.

Still, that brief mention is inadequate to catapult China to worldwide leadership.\n\nBaidu's founder Robin Li, whose search engine is competing with Uber Technologies and Alphabet's Waymo to commercialise self-driving technology, is urging China's government to craft a national-level regulatory framework and offer incentives to facilitate the adoption of AI in a wide range of industries.\n\n\"The development of AI has come to a tipping point,\" said Li, a delegate of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a political advisory body.\n\n\"Whichever country makes a breakthrough in application can have a bigger chance to lead the world in AI technology. China's AI prowess is certainly the second best in the world , if not the best.\"\n\nThe call is echoed by Lei Jun, the chief executive of smartphone maker Xiaomi, dubbed China's Apple, and Liu Qingfeng, the chairman of Shenzhen-listed voice intelligence specialist iFlyTek.\n\nBoth are urging the government to make the development of AI a national strategy, similar to what Beijing has done with \"Made-in-China 2025\", a 10-year action plan to shed the country's image as a cheap manufacturer.\n\n\"Unlike the previous technology revolutions, AI is the once-in-many-decades chance for China to lead the charge in technology,\" said Lei, a lawmaker at the National People's Congress (NPC), the parliament.\n\nHeavy investments poured into cloud computing and big data over the past few years and China's huge talent pool in mathematics undergird the country's ability to close its gap and surpass the US in AI, Lei said.\n\nBaidu's AI-powered facial recognition technology, which beat humans, was recently listed as the \"10 Breakthrough Technologies\" of 2017 by MIT Technology Review.\n\nChina has also overtaken the US, leading the world in publishing academic journal articles on deep learning, a subdiscipline of AI research.\n\nDonald Trump's restrictive immigration policy is giving China an \"unprecedented\" opportunity to attract top talent from overseas to develop AI, said Liu.\n\nIFlyTek's voice technology produced real-time subtitles of the premier's speech at the congress meeting.\n\n\"About one fourth of the US' high-tech firms are founded by immigrants, who are upset by Trump's policies,\" said Liu, who's also an NPC delegate. \"It's the perfect time for China to offer an olive branch to attract global talent on AI.\"\n\nLi also urged the Chinese government to offer more green cards to attract Silicon Valley talent, who may be put off by Trump's policies.\n\nAI has captured media attention, and attracted the most investments by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists since Google's AlphaGo beat the Go world champion Lee Sedol in early 2016.\n\nChina's National Development and Reform Commission approved in February the plan to set up a national engineering lab for researching and implementing deep learning technologies, a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence, the latest government action in developing AI.\n\nHowever, a top-down nationwide action plan on artificial intelligence is still needed for better collaboration among enterprises as a number of national labs, each responsible for the research of one subdiscipline of AI, are scattered across China, said industry insiders.\n\nThe Obama administration released in October 2016 a national strategy on AI, laying out a road map for federal funding for AI research and development.\n\nEntrepreneurs are hoping that the government can allow them access to more data to spur the development of AI, as many see the huge amount of data produced by China's 1.4 billion population a natural advantage to develop the technology.\n\nIn the commercialisation of autonomous cars, an industry that is powered by AI, China needs to open its \"high-definition mapping market to more companies, or risk being left behind by competitors in the rest of the world\", said Geely's founder Li Shufu.\n\nHome to the world's biggest vehicle market, China has set a goal for up to 20 per cent of cars to be highly autonomous by 2025, and for 10 per cent of cars to be fully self-driving by 2030, goals that are expected to take jobs away from professional drivers.\n\nLei predicted that more than 50 per cent of people will be made jobless by AI as the technology is penetrating people's daily lives at a speed faster than expected.\n\nFor example, iFlyTek's voice intelligence has already make stenographers redundant, and is expected to take more jobs away from interpreters, as its machines can translate a dozen languages, including English, Japanese and Korean into Chinese.\n\n\"Many jobs will be taken by AI and the fortunes of society will be controlled by a small number of AI giants,\" Liu said.\n\n\"The government needs to take action now to think about how to better distribute wealth and how to prepare people to move into the AI era. Otherwise it will be too late.\"\n","541":"China is to pump more money into its robotics industry, but industry experts say this alone will not bring the industry up to par with overseas competitors.\nA five-year planning proposal issued yesterday jointly by the ministries of finance and industry and the National Development and Reform Commission vowed to make significant progress by 2020 in the production capacity, creativity and competitiveness of the industry.\u00a0\nBreakthroughs were expected in core components of robots including sensors and servomotors, it said.\nIt also called for building competitive advantage in 10 types of industrial robots capable, for example, of precision welding, surgical applications, vacuum cleaning, performing an array of services and even programming themselves.\nThe proposal lists several other strategies to boost the domestic robotics industry, including more subsidies and tax breaks, and allowing more investment and financing channels.\n\"Local governments at the provincial and city level across the country will soon launch their own supporting policies on subsidies to echo the central authorities and prop up the industry in their jurisdictions,\" said Zhang Fasheng, a sales manager at Shenzhen-based Xrobot Tech.\n\"Subsidies, rent and tax deductions are critical for domestic robot makers,\" Zhang said. \"Especially at this moment of uncertainty in China's economy.\"\nEarly last year, authorities in Guangdong set aside 943 billion yuan (HK$1.13 trillion) to replace human labour with robots by 2018, as the central authorities look to robotics to overcome labour shortages and spur innovation as growth in China's economy slows.\nMeanwhile, the government of Zhejiang (   ) province said it would invest 800 billion yuan to push its 36,000 manufacturers to replace human labour with robots in five years.\nLuo Jun, CEO of the International Robotics and Intelligent Equipment Industry Alliance, a government think tank, agreed that a comprehensive national strategy was necessary to boost the robotics industry in the next five years.\nBut the government proposal was still short-sighted by focusing on investment in existing technology, Luo said.\n\"In the proposal, developing and investing in traditional 'core components' for industrial robots remains China's focus in the coming five years,\" he said.\n\"But these are expected to become outdated and replaced by newer tech for next-generation robots.\"\nSuch an approach was obsolete compared to developments overseas, Luo added.\n\"When we look at Google, Microsoft and Facebook, artificial intelligence is the direction of next-generation robots,\" he said.\n\"I found no mention or thoughts about artificial intelligence in the proposal for our robotics sector.\"\nChina's industrial robot sales totalled 57,000 units in 2014, rising 55 per cent year on year and accounting for a quarter of the world's total.\n","542":"Software developed with artificial intelligence technologies and used at a top hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, has the ability to read computer tomography images almost as accurately as an experienced physician.\u00a0\nThe software - AlphaGo - can read a CT image and provide a result within five seconds.

Since it was introduced at the hospital in June, AlphaGo has become a useful aid for radiologists, according to Xia.\n\"A doctor needs more than 10 minutes to read a CT lung image, but the software only needs five seconds,\" he said. \"It can also identify tumors smaller than 3 millimeters, which are invisible to the naked eye.\"\nWith the reference points provided by the software, the chances of misdiagnosis have been greatly reduced, he said.\nIn July, Alihealth, the medical arm of internet giant Alibaba, released an artificial intelligence system designed to help improve diagnosis.\nThe system, called Doctor You, can read CT lung images and highlight suspicious tumors for further inspection by physicians. The system is expected to be introduced to grassroots hospitals in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, according to the company.\nAlihealth will also cooperate with local governments, hospitals and colleges to develop AI tools that will help medical professionals diagnose 20 chronic and common ailments, including diabetes and ocular problems, the company added.\n","543":"CHICAGO - Relax.

Players win by taking control of the most territory on the board, achieved by surrounding opponent's pieces with their own.\nThe fast-paced format adopted online requires each of the contenders to make at least three moves every 20 seconds.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/27\/148358635386.jpg\nf8bc126e4b2319d7fc8b01.jpg\n","545":"Search engine Baidu Inc will take the lead with the first national lab on deep learning as China strives to rise up the ranks of artificial intelligence research.\nGovt gives firm nod to lead deep learning tech lab\u00a0\nSearch engine Baidu Inc will take the lead with the first national lab on deep learning as China strives to rise up the ranks of artificial intelligence research.\nThe National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic regulator, has appointed Baidu to lead the national lab on deep learning technologies and applications, as Beijing prioritizes AI development through policy and financial support.\nThe company will team up with China's leading institutions such as Tsinghua University and Beihang University in areas including deep learning, interactive technologies, visual and sensory technologies and standardized services.\nBaidu will also share its rich resources on computing, algorithm and big data, which are crucial to beef up fundamental research in AI.\n\"We will give full support and abundant resources to the lab to ensure the mission is accomplished effectively and in high quality,\" said Lu Qi, president of Baidu.\nDeep learning is a leading algorithm that aims to improve search results and computing tasks by training computers to work more like the human brain, said Wang Guanchun, chief executive officer of Laiye, a Beijing-based AI company that provides personal scheduling services.\nThe country is betting on the technology to advance high-end manufacturing as it shifts from an export-driven economy to one that is higher up the value chain.\nFueling the trend is a three-year initiative led by the NDRC and the Ministry of Science and Technology to boost the industry through to 2018, in which China aims to achieve make breakthroughs in core AI technologies, stay in line with global standards on fundamental research, and potentially develop a whole set of transformative technologies on the application front.\n\"AI should be put on the national agenda as it could transform the industrial, service and even the defense sectors.

Some talked with humor, others provided food for thought.\nWUZHEN - There was no lack of excitement at the World Internet Conference (WIC) as tech bigwigs unpacked their ideas. Some talked with humor, others provided food for thought.\nCEO of Sogou Wang Xiaochun stole the show with a speech employing Artificial Intelligence (AI).\u00a0\nAs Wang talked, his voice was captured and precisely transcribed line by line onto a screen behind him, with simultaneous English translation.\nThe awesome part: there were almost no mistakes.\nSogou's voice recognition system is 95 percent accurate in a quiet environment. Translation is 90 percent accurate.\nSogou, a subsidiary of NASDAQ-listed Sohu.com, is best known for its popular Pinyin input system, used everyday by roughly 300 million smartphone users to generate Mandarin from Latin characters. The company also runs a search engine - Sogou - second only to Baidu in the Chinese language market.\nThe search engine of tomorrow will be a question-and-answer robot, Wang said.\n\"The future lies in artificial intelligence. For an input system, to capture and recognize voices is not enough,\" he continued. \"Our input system may find the words and sentences for you, to help you think.\"\nChinese tech companies are becoming more interested in AI research as the dividend from mobile connections alone is on the wane.\nThe past decade was focused on connecting businesses and people, and the growth of tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent. With 90 percent of China's 700 million Internet users on smartphones, there is little room left for expansion in that direction.\nEven Alibaba's Jack Ma admitted at the WIC that the time of \"e-commerce\" will end as all businesses will soon be connected to the Internet in some way or another.\nCheng Wei, chief executive of ride-haall about AI.\nAI research started more than 60 years ago and there have been some major ups-and-downs, Wang explained to his audience. The current wave is backed by unprecedented quantities of data and computing power.\nAlphaGo's victories against legendary Go player Lee Se-dol in 2016 were touted a major milestone in AI development.\n\"I am optimistic there won't be a 'down' this time,\" Wang said.\nA report released by the WIC showed AI research in China attracting $2.6 billion of investment in 2015. Chinese companies have a core competitive advantage against foreign rivals, huge volumes of data with comparatively light restrictions on its use.\nLeading the way is search engine Baidu. Company president Zhang Yaqin told Xinhua that about 15 percent of company revenue went on research and development, mostly relating to AI: $1.5 billion last year.\nBaidu set up its Institute of Deep Learning AI lab in Silicon Valley and persuaded former Google deep learning founder Andrew Ng to jump ship to become chief scientist of the project. The company has developed a range of AI applications around its \"Baidu Brain,\" including self-driving cars and a voice-controlled assistant called Duer.\nThe \"MIT Technology Review\" featured Baidu's Deep Speech among its 2016 top 10 breakthroughs in conversational interfaces. The WIC also put Baidu Brain in its top 15 of the year, prompting a fleet of 15 autonomous cars to appear in the WIC host town of Wuzhen for the public to test \"drive.\" Unfortunately, the limitations of the vehicles were obvious. Staff only allowed members of the public to try out the cars for a few minutes, on a designated section of road, and under close supervision. Taking videos was not allowed.\n\"There might be some problems and we don't want the public to be confused,\" said a Baidu employee. \"Yes, we are doing great, but around the world this technology is still in its early development. Errors are inevitable.\"\nJerry Kaplan, a Stanford University computer scientist who attended the conference, said it is not helpful to compare AI to human intelligence.\nTo him, AI is a collection of tools that allow people to perform tasks with the help of machines, something humans have been doing for two hundred years.\n\"Don't think about it as an artificial person,\" Kaplan told Xinhua in an interview. \"It is rather a toolkit of techniques can be used to solve a specific problem.\"\nZhang, Baidu president, said AI \"can't do everything\" but can free people from repetitive jobs.\n\"Our ultimate goal is to let people do more creative and more interesting things,\" he said.\n","547":"Consider these two scenarios - supercomputers take over the world, destroying their human creators; or else a man-made virus is released, wiping out life on earth. They may sound like the plots of Hollywood sci-fi films, but \"existential risks\" are real and deserve serious study, say the founders of a new centre at Cambridge University.  \nFounded by a philosopher, a scientist and a software entrepreneur, the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) is dedicated to looking at the possible risks to human existence.  \n\"The main threats to sustained human existence now come from people, not from nature,\" says Martin Rees, Britain's Astronomer Royal and one of the centre's co-founders.  \u00a0\nTogether with co-founders Jaan Tallinn, one of the brains behind Skype, and Huw Price, professor of philosophy at Cambridge University, Rees presented the CSER's first public lecture on existential risk last month.  \nRees, a distinguished astrophysicist, has been concerned about existential risk for more than a decade. His 2003 book Our Final Hour looked at the chance of the human race surviving the 21st century - and the conclusion was unsettling, putting the chance of civilisation coming to an end this century as high as 50:50.  \nThe book was influential. It got a lot of people thinking and talking about existential risk, and the calibre of advisers on the CSER team is testament to how seriously the issue is being taken. Cosmologist Stephen Hawking, economist Partha Dasgupta, zoologist Robert May and geneticist George Church are among 26 scientists who have signed on to support the centre.  \nRees says those of us lucky enough to live in the developed world worry about minor risks, such as train crashes or possible carcinogens in food, when we should instead think more about risks that although improbable would be catastrophic if they happened.  \n\"The unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable,\" he says.  \nRees uses the analogy of an insurance policy whereby you multiply the probability by the consequences. If something has devastating consequences even though the chance of it happening is low you still think it's worth taking out insurance.  \n\"Just as we don't feel it was a waste getting a fire insurance policy if our house doesn't burn down, so we shouldn't feel we've wasted our money if we tried to study some of these potential threats,\" he says.  \nCSER's main focus will be on three key areas: synthetic biology, artificial intelligence and extreme environmental threats.  \nThe first is one of Rees' chief concerns. He worries it will become possible for people to create even worse viruses than the ones that cause natural pandemics and that individuals or small groups will misuse this technology.  \n\"For example, there are extreme environmentalists who think there are too many human beings in the world. Imagine if you have one or two people like that empowered by the latest or futuristic abilities in synthetic biology - it's a really scary prospect,\" says Rees.  \nHuw Price, who first became interested in existential risk after a chance encounter with Tallinn and was the instigator of the centre, says his first conversation with William Sutherland, professor of zoology at Cambridge and an adviser to the team, made a big impact on him.  \n\"Bill said he was worried about a time in the not too distant future when you'll have an app on your iPhone which you can use to design your own bacterium,\" says Price.  \nThe big issues of those concerned about the risks of artificial intelligence are whether machines will become more intelligent than humans and what we can do to ensure that machines will have our best interests at heart.  \nIt's the issue Price finds most compelling. He thinks this century the earth will undergo the most significant transition in the history of any planet with life.  \n\"That's the point at which intelligence escapes its biological constraints and exists in other forms. In raw processing terms, machines can work millions, perhaps billions of times faster than we can,\" says Price.  \nIt raises plenty of questions - what form will this intelligence take? Will it be like us? He says artificial intelligence experts vary in their estimates of how far ahead this transition may be. Some suggest it could be as soon as the next 15 to 20 years; others say not until the end of the century. Either way, that's not far off - within the lifetime of those born today.  \nPerhaps not as immediately engaging as a technological threat, but just as potentially devastating are extreme environmental threats. These would involve worst-case scenarios for climate change and are part of a broader concern about mankind's increasing reliance on limited resources and the planet's fragile systems.   \nThe British government's national risk register identifies the perceived risks to the country, and cyberthreats and pandemics are high on that list. What CSER aims to do is to extend that risk register by highlighting threats that might seem unlikely but could annihilate our civilisation.  \nCSER isn't alone in its mission. Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute was founded in 2005 to research threats to humanity, but there is no rivalry. Indeed, the institute's director Nick Bostrom was involved early on in the CSER project and is among its advisers.   \nNot everyone will agree with CSER's concerns and ideas. Price says they hope to overcome any sceptics with the intellectual clout of their impressive team of advisers. After all, if Stephen Hawking says something is worth thinking about, people will listen.  \n \"All these distinguished people have been prepared to lend us their name and say in effect, 'Yes, I think this is important'. And once more distinguished people say that it'll be much harder to sideline,\" says Price.  \nRegular seminars and research reports will give the public access to CSER's findings, although, just like the debate a couple of years ago over whether details of how to modify the influenza virus should be published, some especially sensitive information may be withheld. And it's not just about highlighting risk, but about suggesting solutions and ultimately bringing about international policy change, although those involved are well aware that won't be easy.  \nThe key, says Rees, is long-term thinking at a time when technology is moving ever more swiftly.  \nThis reluctance to think and act long-term is ironic, says Rees, when he considers that almost a century ago England's great cathedral makers thought the world might last only a few thousand years, yet they were prepared to spend 100 years building a cathedral.  \n\"Now we've got much wider horizons, we understand much more and know our planet has a future of millions of years, but we are less likely to plan 50 years ahead than the cathedral makers were - that's very sad,\" says Rees.  \nThe message isn't antitechnology. CSER doesn't want to get in the way of progress, but it wants to drive home the message that there are vital issues that we should be thinking about.  \n\"We aren't doomsters, we don't think the world is doomed, we just think there is a risk which is possibly small but not so small that we should ignore it given the devastating consequences,\" says Rees.  \nYou can find out more about CSER and watch the first public lecture on http:\/\/cser.org \n26  \nThe number of prominent people advising the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk \n","548":"Chengdu is building out its international innovation and communication platforms, and is integrating into the global innovation system, according to local officials.\nThe Medtronic Innovation Center (Chengdu) hosted its groundbreaking ceremony in the Chengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone on Oct 10.

The principles are more qualitative and mysterious than in chess, and depend more on judgment.\nThe first Go program was written by Albert Zobrist in 1968 as part of his thesis on pattern recognition. In 1998, top players were able to beat computer programs while giving handicaps of 25-30 stones, an enormous handicap that few human players would ever take.\nThere was a case in the 1994 World Computer Go Championship where the winning program, Go Intellect, lost all three games against youth players while receiving a 15-stone handicap. In general, players who understood and exploited a program's weaknesses could win with much larger handicaps than typical players.\nChen said it was long believed computer Go posed a problem fundamentally different from computer chess.\n\"Go has features that might be easier for humans than computers,\" he said, adding the game lends itself to a visual nature that is difficult to implement in a computer program.\nyangxinwei@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 10\/23\/2015 page23)\n","554":"Rigid new global initiatives to increase transparency of business data are giving rise to more advanced professional tax services, which employ innovative tools that include cloud computing, financial technology and artificial intelligence.\u00a0\n\"Professional services firms of all disciplines are expecting their workforces to change, which will see many jobs displaced and new roles created for software programmers, data analysts and computer scientists,\" Paul Haswell, a partner at international law firm Pinsent Masons, told the South China Morning Post.\n\"Existing providers who fail to embrace this technology driven future are doomed to obsolescence.\"\nEY, one of the world's four largest professional services networks, on Monday announced the creation of a dedicated group of more than 1,000 professionals from its member-firms across the globe for its new tax technology and transformation practise.\nAlbert Lee, digital tax leader at EY Asia-Pacific, pointed out that the pace of change in tax legislation and the accelerated use of technology by governments for automating compliance and filing processes, are disrupting traditional tax preparations.\nEY's new practise will include a custom tax technology application development, a post mergers and acquisitions tax function, robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and tax analytics and reporting services.\nJim Hunter, managing partner for tax at EY Asia-Pacific, estimated that its tax technology and transformation practise will have more than 5,000 professionals by 2020, helping cultivate new careers for science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates.\n\"We have, by far, the leading practise in this space, because we have pooled all of our tax technology and transformation resources from across the Asia-Pacific and linked them with global resources,\" Hunter said.\nEY's new practise was established in response to many governments' commitment to enhance tax transparency and fight cross-border tax evasion, which has prompted many companies to better manage their digital business data to comply with tax laws.\nThat development is linked with global efforts by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) against base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), which refers to tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations.\nAbout 70 jurisdictions have so far signed the OECD's \"Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Shifting\" - a legal document that offers to help governments counter tax evasion, tax treaty abuse and improve dispute resolution.\n\"Hong Kong indicated its commitment in June 2016 to implement the BEPS package put forward by the OECD.

Instead, it quickly learned to parrot a slew of anti-Semitic and other hateful invective that human Twitter users started feeding the program, forcing Microsoft Corp to shut it down on Thursday .\nFollowing the setback, Microsoft said in a blog post it would revive Tay only if its engineers could find a way to prevent Web users from influencing the chatbot in ways that undermine the company's principles and values.\n\"We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay,\" wrote Peter Lee, Microsoft's vice president of research.

Should these bonuses disappoint, then that might prove an additional inducement to leave.\nBonuses at some leading investment banks were cut this year, with Deutsche Bank slashing its total global bonus payment by 77 per cent, according to its annual report, and UBS cut its global bonus pool by 17 per cent.\nForeign banks, especially European ones, are under pressure to cut costs in their Asian operations and better justify the amount of capital they devote to them. Therefore, as well as cutting bonuses, many have been shrinking their activities or withdrawing from certain business segments or markets.\nMainland Chinese and regional institutions are eager to fill the gaps left by these withdrawals, and this provides an additional reason for the greater number of jobs available, as the relative newcomers need to hire staff to fund their expansions, said Holliday.\nThis too has resulted in a change in the types of employees organisations are looking for.\n\"Someone with extensive knowledge of a particular market in China or Hong Kong,\" he added, \"or with Chinese language skills is likely to be more attractive to an employer than an overseas candidate who is looking to move from an investment banking role in Singapore to one in Hong Kong.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

In the long term, it could affect all of humanity.\nIn short, the age of the robot may finally be upon us.\nIt is a change people in the robotics world have been predicting for years, as engineers design increasingly nimble and intelligent robots able to replace their human counterparts. Robots are cheaper, more productive and - at least so far - not known for bouts of worker unrest. \n\"As technology continues to improve, this [use of robots] will apply to more and more types of tasks,\" said Dr Erik Brynjolfsson,  a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management  and co-author of the e-book Race Against the Machine. \nBrynjolfsson said robotisation comes first to jobs that can be automated easily - factory jobs, like Foxconn's - but will eventually spread to other information-processing and clerical jobs.\nHe admits that Asia, with its plethora of foreign-sponsored manufacturing jobs, will likely feel the  changes first.\nAs labour gets cheaper with automation, Brynjolfsson predicts Western companies will return to their home countries to move products closer to their consumers, re-shoring instead of off-shoring.\nBut for Brynjolfsson, the prospect of robot job take-overs should not be a cause for panic.\n\"Right now, computers are not good at replacing human qualities like empathy and very creative tasks, like what entrepreneurs, artists, high-level managers and scientists do,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"These are some of the limits of machines.\"\nNonetheless, he said,  human workers need to find other types of jobs where they can create more value than machines. That is really  nothing new. Humans have adapted to upheavals in the job market  all through history.\nMany people might seek more education to avoid the change, but, Brynjolfsson said, finding  another realm of work that involves complex physical actions is also good. \nThings  like hair-cutting, repair tasks, salesmanship, gardening and nursing might  not seem \"highly skilled\", but require interpersonal communication and physically dextrous skills that are harder to automate.\nOthers believe even those jobs might not be safe in the future.  Engineers are making strides producing robots that convey human \"emotions\", like empathy, and can help care for the  for the elderly and ill.\nStill, Brynjolfsson says he believes  in entrepreneurs, who will work to combine technology and labour. He cites the case of Henry Ford, who pioneered the modern assembly line, a mechanised process that helped create the modern  auto industry.\nAfter all, humans have for generations fretted about being replaced by machines. Our fears have only been science fiction, right?\nMichael Vassar  sees a darker future.\nAs president of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence,  a global organisation that has since 2004 focused on the future of humanity as it relates to artificial intelligence, Vassar notes that unemployment did indeed rise during the industrial revolution.\nThat is, if you look it from the point of view of the horse. While people were not put out of their jobs by machines, most horses, whose work was purely physical, were.\nThis time, he fears, humans could suffer a similar fate. \nJaan Tallin  is also wary of the rise of robots and artificial intelligence.\nThe Skype and Kazaa co-founder has been travelling the world for two years talking to AI experts and philosophers. As a computer programmer, he fears his peers have been  too blind in creating new technology.\nTo him, losing jobs to robots is inevitable. \"Unemployment will only go up from now on,\" he once said. But what is more concerning to him is what may happen when we create a robot as smart - or probably smarter - than humans.\nGiven the current rate of technological progress - compare the evolution of the eye over millions of years to the advent of digital cameras over several decades - such a future is not so improbable. Tallin thinks it may happen  some time in the next few decades.\nAt that point,  machines can start designing machines and, Tallin believes, humans will be in the same endangered state  gorillas are in right now.\n\"Humans are not actively hostile towards gorillas,\" he said. \"But because of humans, the gorilla's habitat is being destroyed. They have no control of their futures.\"\nOne of the biggest pitfalls of artificial intelligence, Tallin said, is thinking of robots as humans, expecting them to act like humans and do what would be best for humanity according to the rules of evolution, which robots do not abide by.\nAnd it would be hard to make specific enough rules. In Isaac Asimov's  science fiction tale from 1943, Runaround,  one of the laws for robots is, \"A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\"\n\"But if robots really wanted humans not to harm each other, wouldn't it be easier to just sedate them?\" Tallin said.  \nReposed in a floral shirt on a recent visit to Hong Kong, however, the future is not all scary to him. He simply advocates  precautionary principles.\nThe solution, he says, is to be cautious about artificial intelligence, to get people to think about how to create better robots.  Maybe then we can make robots that operate solely on human principles - something called \"friendly AI\".\nTallin has always been a forward thinker. \"We have to formulate in terms of thinking about future societies, what they would have liked to have done,\" he said.\nSomething Tallin and Brynjolfsson and others agree on is that, in the nearer future, robots will make things much cheaper and more affordable. People will be working less.\nBut what will happen in the mean-time? At least in the short run, according to Brynjolfsson, instead of everyone working less, there will simply be more people unemployed while the rest of us work as hard as before. Tallin thinks society, which has been organised around work for centuries, will have to change. \nMarshall Brain,  who is the founder of HowStuffWorks.com  and author of the e-book Robotic Nation,  said, \"The only solution  is for human beings, as a society, to recognise and acknowledge that this is happening and to then take steps that address the steps in a humane way.\"\nHe suggests a kind of \"central bank\" where people instead of governments are paid evenly divided stipends for public goods, such as natural resources, to then spend on products - presumably made by robots - in turn stimulating the economy.\n\"What will be required is a coming together of government, industry and the populace to create a new way of thinking about the economy,\" Brain said.\nAt least for now, coming up with this new way of thinking is up to us humans.\n1m\nIndustrial robots currently deployed worldwide, according  to the International Federation of Robotics\n","564":"A Chinese multinational computer hardware and electronics company has launched an accelerator program in Hong Kong, aiming to provide finance, technology and human resources support for start-ups.\nThe shadow of an attendee sits on a podium wall during a Lenovo Group Ltd news conference in Hong Kong, China, May 26, 2016.

In fact, more foreign companies are investing in Chinese firms that make domestic medical imaging equipment.\"\nStill, problems persist. The Firestone Inventing report showed there were just 402 Chinese companies manufacturing the equipment, accounting for only 10 percent of the market.\nIn addition, the healthcare sector lacks imaging technology in ophthalmology and dentistry.\n\"The major breakthrough for China is to upgrade it by producing high-end products instead of mid - to low-end devices,\" said Yang Hongfei, chief executive officer of Firestone Inventing in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.\nDuring the past five years, there has been a rapid growth of Chinese patents covering the sector. The country now ranks third in terms of the number of medical imaging patents filed behind Japan and the United States.\n\"Big data and artificial intelligence are going to lead the development of medical imaging sector,\" the Firestone Inventing report highlighted. \"Artificial intelligence provides medical imaging with intelligent analysis applications. As for big data, it offers detailed analysis into patients' health.\"\nLast year, the State Council issued a guideline on promoting the application of medical big data in clinical diagnosis, and medical research and development.\nBig data are a term used for crunching vast amounts of statistics to show trends and flaws in market information.\n\"From human body X-rays to telemedicine and medical imaging, we are on the brink of entering a new age of artificial intelligence,\" said Mou Xiaoyong, president of United Imaging Healthcare.\nContact the writers at zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn and zhengyiran@chinadaily.com.cn\nDoctors examine a patient's CT images at a hospital in Beijing.

Personalized orders can be achieved, for example, by leveraging big data that tracks, predicts and meets unique customer demands.\nThe suggestions echoed President Xi Jinping's call for more efforts to promote further integration of the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy.\nOn the medical front, algorithms and robotics have already made a mark in China by reading CT and MRI scans to screen early-stage cancer symptoms. Ma said AI can be further applied to assist doctors in their daily diagnosis, which could spell a boon, notably to those in far-flung areas where medical resources are scarce.\nTo rein in debt evasion and control financial-sector leverage, Ma urged the better use of the troves of data generated online for precise risk-assessment in the booming internet finance sector.\nTechnology can also play a bigger role in the promotion of cultural and educational activities. Interactive games that use augmented reality technology to allow for an immersive experience can be used to support efforts to preserve cultural heritage and raise public awareness.\nThe digital economy accounts for roughly 30 percent of China's GDP and claims a large share of the country's newly-added economic output, according to a report published last year by a research institute under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.\nBy teaming up with local governments, tech majors such as Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu have pulled in resources to help streamline civic services and relieve traffic congestion using data analytics.\nChina is already more digitized than many observers appreciate and has the potential to set the world's digital frontier in the coming decades, according to global consultancy McKinsey, which attributed such success to the government's active role in building world-class infrastructure and shaping healthy digital development through regulation and enforcement.\nhewei@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 03\/06\/2018 page14)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/39\/152029750889.jpg\nf04da2db11221c0824e00d.jpg\n","569":"A \"match of the century\" between human champion of the board game Go and Google's computer program kicked off in Seoul, which drew great attention.\nSouth Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol, center, poses forphotos with Executive Chairman of Alphabet Eric Schmidt,right, andGoogle DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, left, after a press conference ahead of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match in Seoul, South Korea, March 8, 2016.

It will run through next Tuesday to determine the winner between South Korean Lee Sedol, the world Go champion in the past 10 years, and AlphaGo, developed by Google's London-based subsidiary DeepMind.\nThe match of the century drew great attention from news organizations, Go fans and the general public across the world as well as in South Korea as it is seen as a representative match between humans and artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe Korea Baduk Association, a body for South Korean Go professionals, had received advance applications for an explanatory event of the match, but the limit of 60 seats had already surpassed.\nSouth Korea's public broadcaster KBS plans to broadcast live the match from 12:40 to 5 p.m., extending its initial plan to air it for two hours from 3 p.m. due to great interests from the general public.

Some experts had predicted it would take decades of years for AI to defeat humans at the ancient Chinese board game.\nGo, which originated in China more than 2,500 years ago, has been viewed as a grand challenge for AI due to its complexity and intuitive nature.

The talks were preliminary and an acquisition might not happen, the source said.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based firm was offering US$9.5 billion to acquire Ele.me, Chinese tech news site 36kr.com earlier reported.\n\nAlibaba declined to comment. Representatives for Baidu and Ele.me did not comment.\n\nThe new retail concept, pioneered by Alibaba co-founder and executive chairman Jack Ma Yun, refers to the integration of online and offline experiences for consumers, be it shopping, food delivery or buying groceries.\n\nSince last year, Alibaba has spent billions investing in offline and online retail companies such as Suning Commerce Group, Intime Retail (Group), Sanjiang Shopping Club and Lianhua Supermarket Holdings.\n\nFor Baidu, quitting food delivery would come at a time when the company is increasing efforts to remake its dominance of the mainland's internet search business into the country's leading investor in artificial intelligence, with applications from big data analysis to autonomous driving.\n\nThe company, led by founder Robin Li Yanhong, recently displayed its autonomous cars during the widely watched Lunar New Year Gala television event.\n\nIn August last year, Baidu's food delivery arm, Baidu Waimai, merged with Ele.me, ending years of subsidy-driven competition. Baidu's stake in the merged Ele.me was not disclosed.\n\n\"Alibaba wanting to buy Ele.me will leave the food delivery business as Tencent [Holdings]' Meituan and Alibaba's Ele.me. The frenzied early days of food delivery are now over, consolidating to two stable companies,\" said Jeffrey Towson, an investment professor at Peking University.\n\nTowson added that the food delivery service would integrate well into Alibaba's ecosystem of services.\n\nAt the height of the competition between Baidu Waimai, Ele.me and Meituan, customers were offered steep discounts and even free meals in an effort to carve out market share in the fiercely contested food delivery industry, similar to how ride-hailing services Uber and Didi Chu\u00adxing burned through billions of dollars in subsidies to gain users before Didi bought Uber's China operations.\n\nAs of April last year, Alibaba held a 23 per cent stake in Ele.me, after investing close to US$1.2 billion in the company since August 2016 in two separate investments.

Although the company has pushed further into artificial intelligence, the heavy spending does not guarantee bigger profits anytime soon, the analysts said.\n\nSix years ago, Baidu was the mainland's most valuable internet company, with a then market cap of US$46 billion in March 2011. Today, its market cap stands at US$64.6 billion, a 40 per cent growth from that period.\n\nAlibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2014, has already seen its market capitalisa\u00adtion surpass US$300 billion, up more than 30 per cent within two and half years of its trading debut.\n\nTencent, on the other hand, saw its market capitalisation increase sevenfold from HK$350 billion in March 2011 to HK$2.58 trillion now, making it most valuable company in Asia and the tenth biggest in the world.\n\nOnline shopping site JD.com is also catching up Baidu with a current market cap of US$58.6 billion. Not only that, Baidu is also lagging its peers in terms of financial performance.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended March 2017, Alibaba reported a 56 per cent jump in revenue to 158 billion yuan (HK$181.4 billion). Tencent's gross revenues for the calendar year of 2016 increased 48 per cent to 152 billion yuan, and its net profit rose 43 per cent to 41 billion yuan.\n\nBaidu, however, posted a 66 per cent decline in net profit for 2016, while revenues only increased 6 per cent.\n\n\"Baidu relies heavily on online search advertisements to generate most of its revenues. But it's now undergoing pain as people increasingly use smartphones to access the internet,\" said Qin Bo, an analyst for China Everbright Securities.\n\nThe advertss are shrinking sharply, as advertisers reallocate budgets to social media, such as WeChat run by Tencent and mobile commerce platforms run by Alibaba.\n\n\"Baidu suffered a plunge in advertising revenues in the third quarter of 2016, while at the same time Tencent recorded a jump in advertisement income from WeChat and other apps on mobile devices,\" added Aden Fok, an analyst for Industrial Securities.\n\nA cancer death scandal last April also added to Baidu's fiscal woes, after the death of a student who tried an experimental cancer therapy advertised on Baidu, sparked public outcry and tougher restrictions from regulators.\n\nAs the gap between Baidu and its top tech rivals widens, chief executive Robin Li seems intent on pushing ahead with the company's artificial intelligence initiatives.\n\nIn May, he announced Baidu will transform \"completely\" to become a leader in the emerging field, in an open letter to the employees.\nBaidu suffered a plunge in advertising revenues in the third quarter of 2016, while at the same time Tencent recorded a jump in ads income from WeChat and other apps on mobile devicesAden Fok, analyst, Industrial Securities                                                                            \n\"The company's strategy has shifted from 'all-mobile' to 'all-AI',\" said Qin, who is confident Baidu will eventually benefit from its technology breakthroughs, particularly in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and deep learning.\n\nRegardless of the progress, however, he worries slightly how quickly artificial intelligence will become relevant for \u00adBaidu.\n\n\"Big research and development spending has put fiscal pressure on the company and it is likely to affect its profitability in the short term,\" Qin said.\n\nHe is now predicting Baidu's net profit to continue falling in 2017, down 6 per cent from 2016.

In short, machines will substitute for and augment our cognitive power. Many technologists expect that artificial intelligence will go beyond recognizing our friends' faces to driving our cars for us: The utopian scenario is that technology will make rapid communication, information acquisition and knowledge-sharing more accessible and egalitarian.\nIn China, Internet Plus has become a national strategy as Internet and mobile technology are changing the landscape of the country's retail, health, finance, transport and housing - virtually every industry.\nEconomic shift\nHowell said it is an excellent example of how China is moving from an efficiency driven stage of development to an innovation-driven one. It is also a very positive move toward unleashing the creative potential of China's huge human-capital endowment.\n\"This is critical, as I believe that human talent, not financial capital, will be the great driver of growth in the 21st century,\" he said.\nIn addition, Internet Plus builds on an area where China is already an innovator, not just in terms of companies, but also in terms of business models, as many Chinese Internet companies have had to find ways of finding commercial success without the strong advertising markets that companies in the West have been able to build on, according to Howell.\nHe said the WEF shares China's assessment that the Internet and related technologies - while being a driving force behind the evolution and growth in the global economy during past decades - remain \"underused\" and would benefit from further public-sector investment.\nThe Chinese government has given high priority to mass innovation and entrepreneurship to spur on the vitality of the economy. As a staunch preacher of innovation, the founder and executive chairman of WEF, Klaus Schwab, recently remarked that countries will soon no longer be described as \"emerging\" or \"advanced\", but rather \"innovation-rich\" or \"innovation-poor\".\n\"I fully agree with him that the winners will be those countries that have been successful in implementing long-term structural reforms to enable businesses to flourish and talent to be developed in ways that allow wealth to be shared across all the population,\" he said.\nIn Howell's eyes, China's leaders have signaled their clear intent to pursue such policies and are showing promise in implementing them despite near-term economic challenges. He stressed that it is important to frame future competitiveness in terms of \"the entire enabling environment\", rather than one set of factors.\nTechnology also plays a pivotal role in efforts to address climate change, and this year the WEF has specially devoted one of the six theme tracks to the \"green\" or environmental topic.\nLast year China and the United States reached a landmark agreement to cap emissions by 2030. Howell said this was a \"breakthrough\" in terms of breathing fresh life into the process leading up to the UN climate talks in December.\n\"And China's emergence as an increasingly prominent voice in the debate offers us great encouragement that a global commitment can be reached,\" he said.\nSummer Davos themes\n2007, Dalian The Shifting Power Equation\n2008, Tianjin Next Round of Growth\n2009, Dalian Relaunching Growth\n2010, Tianjin Driving Growth through Sustainability\n2011, Dalian Mastering Quality Growth\n2012, Tianjin Creating the Future Economy\n2013, Dalian Meeting the Innovation Imperative\n2014, Tianjin Creating Value through Innovation\n2015, Dalian Charting a New Course for Growth\nzhengyangpeng@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 09\/09\/2015 page21)\n","582":"A boom in financial technology in the mainland is boosting consumer spending by making people more willing to part with their money, according to industry experts.\nWith technology making everything from mobile payments to quick cash loans and wealth management services available at the tap of a smartphone screen, Chinese shopping habits are changing rapidly, they said.\nFor James Zheng, 30, an IT engineer in Beijing, financial technology has fundamentally altered his approach to buying goods.\u00a0\n\"I buy many things from consumer electronics, groceries to daily necessariness online. On average, I spend about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan a month,\" he said.\nThe convenience of mobile payments has made online shopping much easier, while some new financial products such as \"Jingdong white stripe\" have also encouraged online purchases, Zheng said.\nI am actually more generous in my spending because of the convenience of financial products backed by big data and artificial intelligence technology\nJames Zheng, 30, IT engineer, Beijing\nJingdong white stripe is a service offered by e-commerce giant JD.com. It provides small amounts of credit to buyers who can enjoy an interest-free period. A similar product, named Huabei, that offers a deferred payment option is also available on Taobao.com and Tmall, the e-commerce platforms of Alibaba Group, which owns the South China Morning Post.\n\"I am actually more generous in my spending because of the convenience of financial products backed by big data and artificial intelligence technology. But of course, such a change is also because of salary increases I've had, and improvement in financial conditions,\" he said.\n\"China's financial technology in mobile payment has outstripped other countries, and that has changed my purchase habits alot. It's so different from using just a credit card.\"\nLast year, online retail sales in the mainland increased by 26.2 per cent to 5.16 trillion yuan (US$750.3 billion) from the previous year. That compares with a 10.4 per cent growth rate in total retail sales, which reached 33.2 trillion yuan.\nThe rapid development of new financial technologies in China is changing consumers' attitudes towards purchasing goods. Essentially, they are switching from a frugal approach to a more generous mindset, said Li Zichun, a senior analyst with Beijing-based consulting firm Analysys International.\n\"Advances in technology and the popularity of mobile devices have together cemented the foundation of internet finance. As big data and AI technologies are becoming more mature, the uses of financial technology can be widely expanded and are fast becoming a potent driving force of consumption,\" Li said.\nIncreasingly sophisticated AI and big data technologies have also helped ease concerns over security in mobile payment and online credit. Li expects online spending to continue to expand, in particular among the younger generation.\nHowever, the convenience of online spending will inevitably cause a certain level of overspending and irrational consumption, he said. \"Althought overspending will likely be individuals cases, consumer education is needed to prevent the problem worsening.\"\nData from Analysys showed that China's mobile payment transactions in the first three quarter of last year more than doubled to 22.5 trillion yuan from 10.7 trillion yuan in the same period of 2015. While in the US, Forrester Research said mobile payment transactions for the full year reached US$112 billion, or about 770 billion yuan.\nWith the convenience in payment, consumers can make decisions much faster and are less hesitant to spend more\nZhou Jing, chief executive, Dumiao\nTechnology firm Tencent Holdings' WeChat Wallet, and Alipay, managed by Alibaba's affiliate Ant Financial, are the two dominant mobile payment service providers in China.\nThe number of mobile users in China is also expanding. The latest study by the China Internet Network Information Centre, a state-backed agency, found some 469 million people paid with their smart devices in 2016, an increase of 31.2 per cent from a year ago.\nFor Zhou Jing, chief executive of digital lender Dumiao, these figures mean a huge market for the company, which uses financial technology to make lending easier and more efficient to consumers.\n\"Internet finance and fintec are undoubtedly spurring purchases. With the convenience in payment, consumers can make decisions much faster and are less hesitant to spend more,\" Zhou said.\nBy leveraging big data, Dumiao is able to approve or decline loans for consumers in real-time at the point-of-sale. Once they've provide basic information and gone through a simple procedure on their mobile device, they can receive an approval within about 10 seconds.\nWhen consumers are willing to spend more, they will look for digitalised financial product that can provide credit in the most efficient way, Zhou said. By clicking a few buttons on Dumiao's mobile app, a user can receive their loan in a matter of just a few minutes.\nThe company, founded in 2015, has information on 20 million prospective borrowers in 300 cities, and processes about a million applications every month.\nZhou said Dumiao will continue to seek closer cooperation with retailers and other companies.\n\"With an option to obtain quick cash loans during online shopping, it's easier for consumers to buy more expensive goods, which drives consumption,\" she said.\nAs the applications of fintec continue to expand, it has become an area that companies ignore at their peril.\nYirendai, a New York-listed Chinese online lender, sees huge potential as the scope of fintec offerings expands.\n\"Yirendai is making use of fintec in providing consumer lending to individuals, while we are using the technology in robo-advisor services in wealth management,\" said Tang Ning, who founded the company, as well as its parent firm CreditEase, an online lender and wealth manager.\nAs the first fintec company to launch a mobile app for online lending a few years, Tang sees huge potential for Yirendai in consumer lending.\n\"Consumers are in need of convenient and advanced ways to get unsecured loans. Not too much - maybe just tens of thousands of yuan - to satisfy their demands in daily life. But this market is largely untapped,\" Tang said.\nYirendai's strategy is similar to Dumiao in that it is looking to work with more retailers and companies, tapping the need of their customers who want quick cash loans via a mobile app or online.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

[Photo provided to China Daily]\nUS-based electric car startup Faraday Future, backed by LeEco, unveiled its first production vehicle FF 91 in Las Vegas at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, a move to drum up more investment and extricate LeEco from cash flow woes.\u00a0\nThe debut of the FF 91 is seen as the last chance for Jia Yueting, CEO and founder of LeEco, and his debt-laden company, said analysts.\nThe FF 91 represents a bold new breed of electric mobility, which features artificial intelligence, record-breaking acceleration speeds and long-lasting battery energy.\nWith 1,050 horsepower, the vehicle can go from zero to 96 kilometers per hour in 2.39 seconds, making it one of the fastest accelerating cars in the world, according to the company.\nIt can go more than 700 kilometers on one charge. \"No other electric vehicle can do that,\" said Peter Savagian, vice-president of propulsion engineering at FF.\nThe car possesses a complex sensor system and driverless valet feature. By pressing a button on the Faraday mobile app, the car will park itself. It could also learn user's preferences over time to create a personalized experience.\n\"Our mission is not just to build an electric vehicle, but a globally shared internet mobility ecosystem,\" Jia said.\nJia added FF has broken the technological boundaries of internet, artificial intelligence, IT, automobile and electric systems, redefining the core value of car.\nThe car can be ordered by paying a $5,000 deposit through Faraday's website. The first batch is scheduled to be delivered next year.\nAlthough LeEco has faced many challenges, such as supply chain management and capital issues, Jia is still pushing ahead with the electric vehicle initiative.\nLeshi Internet Information and Technology Corp, LeEco's listed arm, said last week LeEco will obtain more than 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) financing from strategic investors.\n\"The debut of FF 91 at the CES shows Jia's determination to build an electric car and restore investor's confidence. However, the prospect of mass-production of the e-car in 2018 will remain slightly out of reach,\" said Shen Meng, director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank in China.\nShen expressed concerns that the event was merely a continuation of LeEco's flamboyant marketing methods, which will do little to save the firm from its biggest problem, its acute cash crunch, against a backdrop of sluggish global economic growth.\nLu Zhenwang, CEO of the Shanghai-based Wanqing Consultancy, cast serious doubt on LeEco's ability to mass-produce the FF 91 by next year.\n\"The launch ceremony was an attempt to gain more support from investors, but where are LeEco's detailed plans, such as the establishment of charging facilities and where it will make these cars,\" Lu said.\nContact the writers through fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/20\/148359321737.jpg\na41f726b084119d7db131b.jpg\n","591":"Thanks to its rapid development over the past few years, digital economy has become a new driver for China's economic transformation and upgrading. For instance, the proportion of the service sector in GDP crossed 50 percent in 2015 and jumped to 54.1 percent in the first half of 2016, contributing 59.7 percent to economic growth.\nDigital economy is also facilitating the transformation and upgrading of China's traditional industries. The application of new equipment and new technologies such as industrial robots, 3D printers, drones and other artificial intelligence is gaining momentum, and the application of big data, cloud computing and internet of things continues to expand.\u00a0\nMany Chinese companies such as Huawei and Gree have climbed up to the mid or high levels of the global industrial chain while seven, including Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu, are among the world's top 20 internet enterprises.\nDigital economy in China is likely to keep growing at a fast pace in the coming years, and will thus have a profound impact on the country's economic transformation and growth.\nThe size of digital economy will expand further, as China's total information consumption is expected to reach 12 trillion yuan ($1.74 trillion) by 2025, and the total volume of e-commerce transactions will reach 67 trillion yuan. In terms of remolding traditional industries into digital economy, the use of cloud computing, big data, internet of things and artificial intelligence will see a significant increase. And big data, like those on land and labor, will become an important factor of production.\nSmart manufacturing is leading a new industrial revolution: digitization, virtualization and intelligent technology will run through a product's life cycle; flexible, internet-based, service-oriented and personalized production will become the new trend of manufacturing; and globalization, service-orientation and platform-based businesses will become a new way of industrial organization.\nBesides, the digital divide between urban and rural areas will gradually narrow, as China's infrastructure for the development of digital economy is expected to further improve in the next few years. The infrastructure for digital economy's rapid development is already in place, as fixed broadband network covers all of China's townships and 95 percent of the administrative villages, and 100-megabytes optical fiber basically covers both urban and rural areas.\nImproved infrastructure for digital economy will also create more opportunities for residents in rural and less-developed areas to participate in the development of digital economy. By the end of 2015, a total of 780 villages had met the entry conditions for selling products online on Taobao, the biggest business-to-consumer e-commerce platform in China. A growing number of farmers are already selling their products and promoting rural tours via e-commerce platforms, while an increasing number of migrant workers and college graduates are returning to their hometowns to start their own businesses.\nDigital economy is also helping promote globalization. China supports free trade and inclusive trade arrangements. While promoting trade liberalization, China will facilitate shared global economic development by using digital economic development as an important element. China is not only developing an \"Internet Plus\" economy domestically, but also remains committed to further opening up its digital market, so as to expedite the integration of domestic and global markets to the benefit of all economies.\nDuring this year's Singles Day shopping carnival on Nov 11, Alibaba, the parent company of Taobao, launched an international version of Taobao, with about 6.21 million online buyers from Russia, Spain, the United States, France and other countries and regions placing $35.78 million worth of orders through the platform.\nAnd while promoting the Belt and Road Initiative (the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road), China will work with 65 countries along the routes. With cooperation in developing digital economy as an entry point, and with cross-border e-commerce as an instrument, China is promoting regional and global trade, investment, capacity and consumption cooperation; expediting the opening-up of digital service trade; and helping build a Belt and Road free trade area network.\nThe author is president of the China Institute of Reform and Development.\n(China Daily 12\/15\/2016 page9)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/33\/148181420419.jpg\n00221917e13e19bc22532d.jpg\n","592":"BOEis currently a top display manufacturer, but plans to seek more value added by innovating.\nA woman tries watching BOE Technology Group Co Ltd's 3D TV, presented at a science and technology expo in Beijing.

Besides the current semantic engine, knowledge system, chat system and practical functions, the team plans to expand openness to other artificial intelligent services, such as affective computing and visual ability.\nAs one of the most innovative domestic startups in artificial intelligence sector, it was established and launched its first generation product on November 6, 2014.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance jointly released a five-year development plan of robotic industry in April.\nAccording to the plan, China will focus on developing 10 signature products in the robotic industry which have high added-value and a promising market demand. The sales figures of robots in the service industry are expected to reach 30 billion yuan by 2020.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/71\/147023029791.jpg\nb083fe955aa1190bea4d0f.jpg\n","594":"The mainland Chinese robotics industry is expected to see about 20 per cent growth this year, similar to last year's but down from the expansion seen in 2014, industry insiders and analysts say.\n\nAbout 80,000 industrial robots are expected to be sold in the country this year, up 20 per cent year on year, according to forecasts from two industry guilds, the GG Robotics Research Institute and the China Artificial Intelligence Robot Industry Alliance.\n\u00a0\nGrowth in the industrial robot market on the mainland slowed last year, with sales up 16 per cent year on year to about 66,000 units, compared with the more rapid year-on-year growth of 55 per cent in 2014 to 57,000 units.\n\nIn the first 10 months of this year, 56,604 industrial robots were sold in the mainland, according to the latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nSeveral factors slowed robot industry growth, GG Robotics Research Institute founder Zhang Xiaofei said. \"The manufacturing market is tough in China this year following an economic slowdown, while costs for those domestic industrial robot makers remain high because of the lack of development of technology breakthroughs in core components for mass production.\n\n\"Government incentives such as subsidies are not as attractive and generous as 2014 and earlier last year,\" he said.\nThe fever in investing in robotics has come to an end for the time beingWang Cairong, China Artificial Intelligence Robot Industry Alliance\nInvestment in robotics was becoming cautious, especially in venture capital, he added.\n\nThe automotive and 3C (computer, communication and consumer electronic) industry were the biggest customers for industrial robots, accounting for about 60 per cent of sales, Zhang said.\n\nTao Yuxia, sales manager for LXD Robotics, one of Guangdong's biggest robot makers, said the firm saw a big jump in sales this year. \"I think our annual sales this year will reach about 200 million yuan (HK$224 million), more than 50 per cent over last year,\" she said. \"About 60 per cent of clients are manufacturers from the Pearl River Delta, 10 per cent from overseas and the rest from other provinces.\"\n\nBut earlier this year, the company had expected its annual sales for this year would reach 300 million yuan - a sign that China's \"robotic fever\" is cooling down.\n\nDriven by government policies to replace human labour with robots, about 3,000 new robot-related companies - robot makers or automation solutions suppliers - have emerged since 2014, mostly in the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta, according to Wang Cairong, secretary general of the China Artificial Intelligence Robot Industry Alliance. As of September this year more than 100 publicly listed firms had invested in the robotic industry.\n\n\"But the fever in investing in robotics has come to an end for the time being,\" Wang said. \"The large amount of capital investment flocking into the market has slowed after finding that the market is not so highly profitable,\" he added.\n\nZhang said despite the impressive sales growth figures most domestic robot makers and system integrators were not profitable because of fierce competition. \"Most Chinese robot manufacturers are facing the same dilemma they faced a year ago - they are still relying heavily on imported materials and lack the technology to independently produce high-end industrial robots.\"\n\nWang and Zhang believe that industrial robot sales will continue to see flat growth next year amid the uncertain economic environment.\n\nZhang said low-and-middle-end industrial robots - like a four-axis robot or the SCARA robot - would contribute to a large quantity of sales next year because of their affordability.\n\nRegardless of the economic situation, the need to replace human labour with robots due to soaring labour costs and inflation would drive demand over the long term, according to the two industry experts. Growth would also be driven by manufacturers in the chemical, food and consumer goods industries, they said.\n\nThe average price of industrial robots would continue to decrease next year because of the fierce competition, Zhang said, meaning the profitability of most domestic robot makers would be lower than this year.\n\nChina is already the world's largest market for industrial robots, accounting for a quarter of global sales, according to the International Federation of Robotics. The annual sales target for industrial robots in the manufacturing sector is 150,000 by 2020.\n\nWang warned that the consumer robot market was plagued by low-quality products, overinvestment and duplication.\n\nIndustry insiders saw that the market was depressed in the past few months of this year, according to Wang Gang, a spokesman for Ingdan.com, a one-stop supply-chain platform that links technology start-ups and entrepreneurs with contract electronics manufacturing partners in China.\n\n\"Consumers were not interested in consumer robots priced at 1,000 yuan or above. We suggest those start-ups try to sell their products to second-and-third tier cities priced at about 500 yuan,\" Wang said. \"Many consumer robots designed in China are based on an android [operating] system and are just like a smartphone with a robot look, which can be only used as an expensive toy for children,\" Wang said.\n\n\"Last year, automated waiters that were able to take orders and deliver food to customers' tables made local headlines at Shenzhen's hi-tech fair. This year, they were all gone. It will be extremely tough for domestic consumer robot start-ups to lure investment in the current market,\" he said.\n","595":"We all know about the Skynet scenario. It was the background story to the popular sci-fi                Terminator film series in which a fully autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) system used by the US military ended up launching a global thermonuclear war to eliminate humanity and take over the world.              \n\"It saw all humans as a threat; not just the ones on the other side,\" a character from the series helpfully explained. \"It decided our fate in a microsecond: extermination.\" \u00a0\nEarly this month, a group of prominent scientists, entrepreneurs and investors in the field of artificial intelligence, including physicist Stephen Hawking, billionaire businessman Elon Musk and Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate in physics, published an open letter warning against the potential dangers as well as benefits of AI. \nGiven the calibre of the people involved, the letter has generated extensive media coverage, and even lively debate among the cognoscenti. Much of the debate naturally focuses on the more sensational warnings contained in the letter and in select passages from the position paper that accompanied it. \nCan AI systems become an existential threat to the human race? Reponses range over a whole spectrum. Some pundits follow the position of the distinguished American philosopher John Searle, who has questioned if the strong version of AI - that is, machines that can learn from experience and model behaviour like a human brain, except with incomparably greater computing powers and therefore cognitive abilities - is even possible at all. \nOthers, like science writer Andrew McAfee, argue strong AI is possible but we are still a long way from it to need to worry about it seriously. \nBut their arguments are rather abstract and remote. \nSo it's the first half of the position paper that is most relevant to people today, and also the most interesting. It asks pertinent questions and discusses likely but troublesome scenarios that already confront us today. \nIt's here that the group raises moral, legal and technical questions related to current and soon-to-be-available \"smart\" systems. These are semi-autonomous and quasi-intelligent machines or systems that are already around us: driverless cars, drones, computerised trading systems for stocks, bonds and currencies, voice and face recognition software, automatic language translators, surgical robots and automated medical diagnoses. The list is already endless.\nThe position paper provides useful programming rules and guidelines for AI or semi-AI systems: \n1. Verification: how to prove that a system satisfies the desired formal properties. (\"Did I build the system right?\")\n2. Validity: how to ensure that a system that meets its formal requirements does not have unwanted behaviour and consequences. (\"Did I build the right system?\")\n3. Security: how to prevent intentional manipulation by unauthorised parties.\n4. Control: how to enable meaningful human control over an AI system after it begins to operate. (\"OK, I built the system wrong, can I fix it?\")\nThese nifty criteria are not just good for AI developers, but more importantly, for their users, consumers, regulators and informed citizens, to determine the robustness and benefits of semi-AI systems that are already with us.\nTired of labour disputes and unrest on the mainland, for example, Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn is investing billions to build fully automated factories. Procter & Gamble, the former owner of Pringles, the snack potato chips brand, got rid of the human workforce years ago to use supercomputers to control the insertion of the chips into their container tubes to make sure they stack up and don't crack during production. \n\"When and in what order should we expect various jobs to become automated?\" the position paper asks, warning full automation will mean high wages for those versed in the technical complexity and unemployment for most. \"There is a difference between leisure and unemployment,\" it says. \nThe US  has    a temporary ban on research on autonomous weapon systems that require minimal or no human supervision.  But it could be argued that smart weapons, free  of human biases  and emotions, could be more \"moral\" in their ability for clean strikes to minimise civilian casualties. \nFour states in the US are ready to authorise driverless cars on the road. But if one crushes or hurts a person, who should be responsible and how would their insurance policies work?\n Sensors are being developed to help cars avoid hitting other cars and people. But what if a driverless car is caught up in a situation where to avoid hitting a young family of four, it has to run over an old couple? This is beyond artificial intelligence, but artificial                moral intelligence.              \nWe should thank Hawking, Musk and their friends for asking us to ask these questions before we are in over our heads with autonomous machines. \nAlex Lo edits the science page\nWhen and in what order should we expect various jobs  to become automated?\nPosition paper on AI\n","596":"Long, narrowly spaced rows of shelves fill a multi-storey building about the size of two sports fields.

But no other facility can match the productivity of the farm in the city of Xichang, in the southwestern Sichuan province.\nNearly 28,000 full-sized cockroaches per square foot were being produced there annually, the Sichuan government said in a report submitted to Beijing early this year.\u00a0\nIt is the first time in history so many cockroaches have been confined and bred in one space. The project had achieved so many \"scientific and technological breakthroughs\" that it deserved a national science award, the provincial government said.\nThe facility achieved its unrivalled efficiency partly by being controlled by a \"smart manufacturing\" system powered by\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, according to the report.\nThe system constantly collects and analyses more than 80 categories of \"big data\", including humidity, temperature, food supply and consumption. It monitors changes such as genetic mutations and how these affect the growing rates of individual cockroaches.\nAI is changing China in many sectors, from powerful facial recognition systems capable of identifying 1.3 billion citizens in seconds to nuclear submarines that can help a captain make faster, more accurate decisions in combat.\nMeet the roachbot: scientists hope crushable robotic insects may help in disasters\nIn the cockroach farm, the AI system learns from past work, self-adjusting to improve cockroach production.\nDr Zhang Wei, former assistant researcher at the College of Mechanical Engineering at Zhejiang University, who was involved in the development of the system, told the\u00a0South China Morning Post: \"There is nothing like it in the world. It has used some unique solutions to address some unique issues.\"\u00a0\nRustling in the darkness\nZhang confirmed the use of AI technology in the project but declined to give details.\nThe farm is operated by the Gooddoctor Pharmaceutical Group in Chengdu, Sichuan, which confirmed the validity of the government document but could not answer the\u00a0Post's queries because the matter involved trade secrets.\nAccording to a 2011 report by government newspaper\u00a0Guangming Daily, a visitor must change into a sanitised working suit to avoid bringing in pollutants or pathogens.\n\"There were very few human beings in the facility,\" the article stated.

Wherever the beam landed, there was a sound like wind blowing through leaves.\n\"It was just like standing in the depths of a bamboo forest in late autumn. The cool breeze blows, and the leaves rustle.\"\nCould super-breed terrorise a city?\nThe sheer number of insects locked in the facility - the largest colony of cockroaches ever to have existed on the planet - conjures some nightmarish scenarios.\nProfessor Zhu Chaodong, the Institute of Zoology's lead scientist in insect evolution studies at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, said it would be a \"catastrophe\" if billions of cockroaches were suddenly released into the environment - be it through human error, or a natural disaster such as an earthquake that damaged the building.\nTo Xichang's near-800,000 inhabitants, one such accident could be \"terrifying\", Zhu said. The farm is also located close to Xichang's Qingshan airport.\nNoisy neighbour? Try sharing a plane with an infestation of cockroaches\n\"Multiple lines of defence must be in place and work properly to prevent the disaster of accidental release,\" Zhu said.\nCockroaches multiply rapidly in a suitable environment, said Zhu. Given Xichang's warm climate and ample rainfall, a dozen of them could infest an entire neighbourhood.\nThere are also concerns that the farm's intensive reproduction and genetic screening would accelerate the insect's evolution and produce \"super-cockroaches\", of abnormal size and breeding capability, although Zhu said this was unlikely to happen.\nReturn to sender: Chinese customs officers discover delivery of giant cockroaches from Germany in the mail\nCockroaches are believed to have been around since the dinosaurs, surviving extreme environmental conditions that brought extinction for other species.\n\"Every cockroach is a super-cockroach,\" Zhu said. \"Mother Nature has already done its job. There is little room left for us to make improvements.\"\nCreating the potion\nAt the time of the government report, the farm had generated a total of 4.3 billion yuan (US$684 million) in revenue over the years by manufacturing a potion made entirely of cockroaches.\u00a0\nWhen they reach the desired weight and size, the cockroaches are fed into machines and crushed to make the potion, which had \"remarkable effects\" on stomach pain and other ailments, said the provincial government.\nIt's no gag: cockroach milk is one of the world's most nutritious and calorie-rich substances, scientist says\nThe potion has a tea-like colour, tastes \"slightly sweet\" and has \"a slightly fishy smell\", according to the product's packaging.\nMore than 40 million patients with respiratory, gastric and other diseases were cured after taking the potion on doctors' prescriptions, according to the official report, which stated that the farm was selling it to more than 4,000 hospitals across the country.\nThe miracle-like cure\nCockroach has been an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. In some rural areas in southern China, infants are still occasionally fed cockroaches mixed with garlic to treat fever caused by an infection or upset stomach.\nThe Chinese government funded nationwide studies into cockroaches' medical value that, after more than two decades of laboratory investigation and clinical trials, had discovered or confirmed dozens of disease-fighting proteins and biochemical compounds with huge potential value in medicine.\nThousands of pages of Chinese medical journals have detailed findings suggesting the rejuvenating effect of the cockroach potion. It could stimulate regrowth of damaged tissues such as skin and mucosa, the sticky membrane on the surface of internal organs that was difficult to heal and caused chronic pain.\n'They're like my children': The woman who keeps 100,000 cockroaches in her home\nPatients suffering burns or serious stomach inflammations recovered faster with the potion treatment than without, according to numerous studies.\n\"The potion is not a panacea - it does not have a magic power against all diseases,\" said a researcher experienced in cockroach-related medicines at the Institute of Materia Medica at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) in Beijing.\n\"But its effect on certain symptoms is well established, and confirmed by molecular science and large-scale hospital applications.\"\nPatients learn the Latin\nThere is a potentially major disadvantage to the potion, according to the CAMS researcher, who requested not to be named. \"The source of raw material, to most people, is disgusting,\" she said. \"That is an important reason why the use of the potion is not found in other countries.\n\"Even in China, most patients might not know the liquid came from cockroaches.\"\nThe potion is not for sale over the counter, but the\u00a0Post has bought it in a drug store in Beijing without being asked for a doctor's prescription.\nA pack containing two bottles of 100ml cost more than 50 yuan (US$8).\nOn the packaging and in the user instructions, only one ingredient was listed: Periplaneta americana, the Latin name of the American cockroach, one of the largest cockroach species.\nThe internet has played host to lively discussions about the medicine, known as Kangfuxin Ye, or \"potion of recovery\".\n\"I searched for Periplaneta americana when drinking the potion. I saw the picture and spat it all on screen,\" wrote one user on Baidu Tieba, the large Chinese online community run by search engine company Baidu.\nSeveral patients who had consumed the potion told the\u00a0Post they were not aware of its content when they drank it.\n\"This is knowledge I'd rather live without,\" said a young mother in Beijing who was prescribed it to accelerate recovery after giving birth a year ago.\n\"I don't know the effect, but I healed eventually,\" said another patient, who took the potion to cure a back injury.\n'Disgusting but powerful'\nHan Yijun, a representative of Gooddoctor Pharmaceutical Group in Beijing, has denied the company misleads patients by referring to the giant cockroach by its academic name.\n\"Our drug has been used in hospitals for many, many years and established an enormous number of fans,\" she said.\nSome patients with chronic stomach illness were taking the potion regularly because it could relieve their pain significantly, she said.\n\"They all know it's made from cockroaches,\" Han said. \"It is a disgusting insect, but there are hardly any drugs on the shelves with the same effect.\"\nCopyright (c) 2018.

It will also be able to generate structured summaries of data, such as traffic volume and speed in particular lanes, to detect accidents or any incidents that obstruct traffic.\nAlibaba's electronic trading hub goes live in Malaysia\nThe Malaysian City Brain can also be integrated with systems that manage emergency dispatches and ambulance calls, identifying the quickest route and adjusting traffic flow for emergency vehicles to arrive within the shortest time at their destination, according to Alibaba Cloud.\nLarge enterprises, start-ups, universities and other academic institutions will have the opportunity to access artificial intelligence tools used by City Brain to drive innovation in other areas as its functionality expands.\nThe initiative would likely be viewed as a positive development for Malaysian Prime Minister Razak Najib's upcoming general election campaign if the City Brain helps use taxpayers' money more efficiently - a sore point for Malaysian voters who have complained about rising costs of living.\nMalaysia is also part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which was launched by Beijing to promote economic cooperation among countries across Asia, Europe and Africa. The Belt and Road Initiative is expected to bring benefits such as increased trade, access to new markets as well as more foreign direct investment to the country.\nAlibaba Cloud to use artificial intelligence to smooth Hangzhou traffic flow\nAlibaba Cloud's City Brain was first implemented in September 2016 at the Xiaoshan district of Hangzhou, the city where Alibaba is headquartered. New York-listed Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\"Cloud computing, data technology and AI has become fundamental tools for all companies and organisations to operate effectively,\" said Hu, who also serves as a senior vice-president at Alibaba.\nAlibaba had earlier partnered with Malaysia on the electronic world trade platform (eWTP), the brainchild of Alibaba founder Jack Ma Yun.\nWith the eWTP, small and medium enterprises in both the mainland and Malaysia will be able to conduct cross-border trade easily. Ma has also been appointed as Malaysia's digital economy adviser.\nAlibaba is not the only Chinese technology company looking to use its artificial and cloud computing technology for smart city initiatives.\nIn December, Chinese search engine operator Baidu signed an agreement with Xiongan New Area to turn it into a smart city, powered by intelligent transport. Xiongan New Area is a special economic zone that will play a central role in Chinese President Xi Jinping's plan to integrate the development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

The Hong Kong government has pledged a five-fold increase in investment in the innovation and technology field for the next financial year, focusing on infrastructure construction of innovative platforms and attracting talents. (GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SERVICES)\nThe Hong Kong government has pledged a five-fold increase in investment in the innovation and technology field for the next financial year, focusing on infrastructure construction of innovative platforms and attracting talents.\u00a0\nHong Kong must optimize its resources by focusing on developing its areas of strength, namely biotechnology, artificial intelligence, smart city and financial technologies\nPaul Chan Mo-po, Financial Secretary, Hong Kong\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said in his 2018-19 Budget speech on Wednesday HK$50 billion will be set aside to help the SAR catch up in the fierce regional tech race.\nFor the 2017-18 fiscal year, only HK$10 billion was allocated for the sector.\n\"Hong Kong must optimize its resources by focusing on developing its areas of strength, namely biotechnology, artificial intelligence, smart city and financial technologies,\" Chan said.\nOf the amount, HK$20 million will be spent on infrastructure construction and initial operations in the first phase of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park in the Lok Ma Chau Loop -- one of the most significant tech projects undertaken by the SAR.\nThe financial chief estimated the entire project would eventually cost far more than the amount allocated, and additional resources will be provided to enable the park to go into operation as early as possible.\nAgnes Wong, tax partner at PwC Hong Kong, said the government's large financial support could lift professionals' confidence in working on the project, facilitating its long-term development.\nThe park is a wholly-owned subsidiary company of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) and is designed to be co-developed by the SAR and Shenzhen.\nThe first plot of land is expected to be delivered to HKSTPC in 2021 or earlier, according to government sources on Wednesday. Once completed, the project would be the biggest science park in Hong Kong -- four times larger than the existing Hong Kong Science Park in Tai Po.\nIn addition, the SAR government will inject HK$10 billion into HKSTPC for the building of research-related infrastructure and facilities, enhancing support for its tenants and incubatees, as well as setting up a Smart Campus at the park.\nWilton Chau, professor of practice in entrepreneurship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, described the huge increase in government investment, compared with the previous financial year, as \"surely a good thing\" for the development of the city's innovation and technology field.\nHe said the government has provided the first lump sum of money for budding businesses to develop, but the key is to sustain the growth in future. To achieve that goal, he believes, attracting talents and nurturing an innovative ecosystem are of greater significance.\nIn this respect, the government will allocate HK$10 billion to set up two research clusters on healthcare technologies, artificial intelligence and robotic technologies.\nThey are expected to attract the world's top scientific research institutions and technology enterprises to Hong Kong for conducting more research and development projects in collaboration with local universities and scientific research institutions.\nBesides, the Technology Talent Scheme, which was unveiled in the Chief Executive's maiden Policy Address last year, will be implemented in the second half of this year with an investment of HK$500 million. Government sources said selected talents in the scheme may receive an incentive of about HK$32,000 each month.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/69\/152015613975.jpg\n\n","599":"Popular Chinese online content aggregation app Toutiao is deploying more resources to its fast-growing experimental lab to attract more users in the digital age, which will increasingly be decided by intelligent technologies, advanced big data solutions and the growth of \"We-Media\" information platforms.\nThe company rolled out its first artificial intelligence robot during the recent Rio Olympic Games.\u00a0\nThe robot, which specializes in editing sports stories related to China in Chinese language, drew a lot of interest and rave reviews.\nToutiao and Peking University jointly developed the robot, named \"Xiaomingbot\", in Toutiao's lab for AI.\nThe robot is capable of generating a report in just 2 seconds after the end of a sports event - it produced more than 450 pieces of sports news during the Olympics.\nThe news robot can certainly be a good partner for readers as it can efficiently edit news that involve a lot of data and information, amid growing demand for the reports via smartphones, computers and traditional media such as newspapers and TV broadcasts, the lab's director Li Lei said.\nNews stories written by the robot have been read by more than 1 million users already.\nConnected to an Olympic database, the robot selected pictures for each of its news item and used an advanced language-sorting system to ensure correct grammar and spelling.\nAn intelligent robot that was used to edit news for the first time can be tracked back to 2009 in the United States.\n\"The first phase in the future of artificial intelligence is the birth of 'super intelligence' in many vertical fields,\" said Zhang Yiming, founder and chief executive officer of Toutiao.\n\"Our first innovation is to recommend personalized information to various users based on their reading habits, interests and preferences. After all, different people have different perspectives and demands when it comes to information,\" he said.\nThe four-year-old company had accumulated 530 million users by August this year.\nIt has 55 million active daily users.\nTo better understand its users, the app observes and analyzes 48 million users via its big-data system, generating 100 TB of data every day.\n\"In terms of technical research, our teams have established a large number of personal user models to recommend more precise information to the users,\" Zhang said.\n\"We do this after analyzing the reading times, user habits and environment.\"\n\"We are also encouraging the diversification and development of 'We-Media' through a specialized service for information contributors as their opinions, news sources and influences are playing a bigger role in China's media market,\" Zhang said.\nSo far, over 210,000 people are running their own media accounts on Toutiao. Contents generated originally on Toutiao receive more than 120 million views every day.\nIn July alone, individual media run on Toutiao earned about 22.36 million yuan of revenue. And more than 25,000 account owners received their shares every day.\nZhao Ying, a researcher at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Industrial Economics, said these integrated business operations inspire the rise of an industrial chain.\nMedia enterprises with an integrated nature are more capable of expanding cooperation across sectors, industries and regions to develop into conglomerates with complete industrial chains and more businesses.\n\"Compared with traditional media, personalized digital news via platforms such as Toutiao can effectively inject headlines into people's smartphones,\" Zhao said.\n\"Big data technology can also help editors from these highly marketable platforms develop an earlier flair for finding human-interest stories and focusing on red-hot social issues.\"\nzhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 09\/04\/2016 page21)\n","600":"JD, one of China's leading online retailers, will challenge Amazon.com Inc in Europe by establishing operations across the continent within the next few years, said the firm's boss.\u00a0\nE-commerce titan to take on Amazon with services in more regions\nJD, one of China's leading online retailers, will challenge Amazon.com Inc in Europe by establishing operations across the continent within the next few years, said the firm's boss.\nLiu Qiangdong, founder and chief executive of JD, said his company will launch its first European e-commerce platform and delivery services in France, with plans to roll out to the United Kingdom and Germany. In the UK, JD will also open an artificial intelligence research center in Cambridge and offices in London.\nLiu confirmed the company plans to spend at least 1 billion euros ($1.24 billion) in the next two years to build JD's logistics network in France in a bid to challenge Amazon by 2019. Amazon said it has invested 15 billion euros in Europe since 2010.\nJD, which Bloomberg valued at $68 billion in January, is also preparing to operate in the United States by the end of the year, starting off in Los Angeles. Liu told the Financial Times that the company wants to ensure 50 percent of its profits come from outside China within 10 years.\nThe Cambridge research center - the company's first in Europe - will focus on artificial intelligence and big data. It is set to open during the first half of 2019.\nLiu said British talent and education is first class, adding that the cost of hiring talent specializing in AI was now lower in Europe than in the US and China.\nFollowing Liu's recent meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May in Beijing during her official visit to China, the e-commerce giant announced plans to sell 2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) of UK goods to Chinese consumers in the next two to three years, including luxury British couture and tea, chocolate, beauty products and home appliances.\nThe agreement signed between JD and the British government's Department of International Trade is focused on making it easier for British companies to access the Chinese market via JD.\n\"It is unrealistic to establish a JD logistics network in the European market, as the population density is relatively low there, and the transportation and labor cost is very high,\" said Lu Zhenwang, CEO of Wanqing Consultancy in Shanghai. Lu added the success of JD in the domestic market lies in its mature and sophisticated delivery network, but the situation in Europe is totally different.\nThe number of UK brands on JD's platform has doubled during the last two years, with sales in 2017 growing 100 percent year-on-year.\nContact the writers at wangmingjie@mail.chinadailyuk.com\nLiu Qiangdong, CEO and founder of China's e-commerce company JD, and Fives group Chairman Frederic Sanchez attend a signing ceremony at a France-China forum in Beijing on Jan 9, 2018.

What is innovation from your perspective?\nZuckerberg: I think it's to look out for five to 10 years to see what problems exist that you can take on over a long period of time. If you are solving an immediate problem today, to a lot of people it does not feel like innovation.\nAt Facebook, we focus on three sets of problems we want to solve over a long period:\nThe first is to help spread Internet connectivity, to have every person in the world have Internet. Today, with 7 billion people in the world, there are still more than 4 billion not (connected). They do not have access to all kinds of information and opportunities.\nThe second focus is artificial intelligence. We will have computers that can process the world and understand senses of vision and dreams, better than people. Computers may not be smarter than we are, but there will be a lot of progress in 10 years.\nThe third area is building the next computing platform based on VR. New computing platforms emerge every 10 or 15 years. They become more natural, immersive and can help us better interact in the world. I think the latest one will be augmented or virtual reality.\nAI has attracted worldwide attention with the Go game, a game that is originated in China. What is your take on this event? What is the future of AI from your perspective?\nZuckerberg: Google deserves huge credit for their research that led to this historic win. But I think when we see these milestones of AI, we tend to think that we are very close to having general computing intelligence that can solve any problem. But the reality is that when it comes to AI today, we have one really big trick, which is large pattern recognition.\nWhether it is looking at an image or recognizing what's in that. They all actually come down to the basic technology that you are looking at some data to recognize a pattern in it.\nBut the thing that makes humans unique today is that I think we would call it common sense or the ability to learn in one domain and then have it applied to another domain that you want to solve a problem in. So you got a computer that can play Go, but that doesn't help that computer solve other problems in other places.\nMa: I think machines will be stronger and smarter. But a machine can never be as wise as human beings.\nI am a terrible Go player. When we play games, it is fun to see the other guy make mistakes. When you play with computers, they never make mistakes. It is not fun at all.\nOne thing for sure, wisdom, soul and heart are things that human beings have and machines can never enjoy failure, success, friendship and love. So I don't think we should be scared about machines. Instead, we should use machines as an innovative, effective way to solve problems.\nHow do you see the future of VR?\nZuckerberg: The idea is that VR can produce an immersive, 360-degree digital experience. For instance, recently we had a demo at Facebook where you can put on a headset, move around and play a game with someone else in another room but it feels like he is there. But then when you change the headset and then you play ping pong with another person in another room somewhere.\nVR is really helpful for entertainment, education and helping people simulate different environments. The first application is going to be gaming.\nI think 2016 will be a really good year for VR to start to ship. In the beginning, the market is small and there will be five to 10 years before it become a really big thing. But if you want to start with shipping something, and let a lot of people enjoy it, I think it is going to be 2016.\nMa: Frankly, I don't understand most of what Mark was saying. I believe a lot of people here don't understand it too. But I remember when I started my Internet business in 1994, I had no idea of what Internet was. What I was thinking was how this tech would help others do things easier. Similarly, when I think of VR, I ponder over how can the tech make it easier for women and girls to shop on our site and how can it help people better sell things online.\nWhat is the most surprising innovation you've seen? What technology will change the world in future?\nZuckerberg: Google's AlphaGo is the most surprising innovation I have seen this year, because experts in the field have thought there would be a few more years before AI could defeat expert human Go players. So AI research is proceeding at a very good pace.\nI got really excited about self-driving cars because they will save a lot of people's lives. There is no reason why a computer that doesn't sleep, that always pays attention, that has good memory can't drive the car better than people. It will be one of the most important advances in science over the past several decades. I also look forward to the application of AI in the science of health.\nMa: I think there will be a big breakthrough in life science in the next 20 to 30 years. People will live longer and healthier with the help of computing and data.\nIn the past 300 years, science was so fast and people made great progress in understanding the outside world, but we know so little about ourselves. Human beings can't decode the codes of ourselves.\nI hope in 200 years there will be a law which says nobody should live more than 200 years! I have high expectation on life science.\nSince both of you are bicultural, it'd be very interesting to know from both of you what're the differences between the two cultures in terms of making innovation?\nZuckerberg: One thing I'm optimistic about China is its emphasis on engineers. More of the jobs that we see everywhere around the world are increasingly technical. These are the highest-paid and most impactful jobs in a lot of places. In general, there is a huge constraint around the world on the number of good engineering students in universities. I think China gets it right by emphasizing this for a long time. When you look at the government here, lot of folks in governments are engineers. The mindset of problem solving comes from discipline.\nCertainly countries all over the world are trying to train engineers, but based on my experience, it is definitely one of the things that is more emphasized in China than in other places, and I think it is a real advantage.\nMa: I once had a discussion with one of my best American friends. He said: Jack, I worry about China, because in 20 years, China's GDP will be bigger than that of the United States. You will be more powerful than the US. You are going to control the world like the Americans do.\nI said: Why do you think like that way? He said: Because we think like that way. Well, this is the cultural difference.\nThe religion of the Western world is very competitive. They need a competitor. Either you are on my side or you are on the other side. As a company, you need to have a competitor. Whatever you do, you need to figure out what your competitors are doing.\nBut in China we are different. The religions of China - Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism - are all about being harmonious. How we can change ourselves to meet the outside world. Taoism is about how can I change myself to meet the environment and Confucianism is about how can I change myself to be harmonious with the society. Buddhism is about how can I change my behavior to meet my heart or coordinate with my heart. So in the oriental culture we are not that competitive. We always try to think about how we can change ourselves to meet the others.\nThree hundred years ago, all human beings, both in the West and the East, relied on philosophy and religion. But in the past 200 years we only focus on knowledge. What I feel is that the West represents more on knowledge and the East focuses more on wisdom.\nSo who will win? I believe those people who can blend the two cultures will win.\nThis is why I show great respect and love to Western culture. I believe both cultures and religions are wonderful and we should respect each other. Don't always think about how to compete, but think about how we can work together.\nBoth of you are entrepreneurs. Any advice to those who want to become entrepreneurs like you?\nZuckerberg: I think you should focus on solving a problem rather than starting a company. In Silicon Valley it is really cool to have a company. A lot of people start a company before they know what problem they want to solve. That is crazy. From what I can tell, most of the companies that end up achieving big missions in the world or building great enterprises start with a mission, whether it is solving a country problem or serving some customers, or creating some product to change the world. When you find your mission and have someone actually like it and use it, you will find employees to push it further to the world.\nMa: My advice is that you have to believe in what you are doing. You have a mission, you want to solve a problem and you believe it. You do it not because the others are doing it. You do it not because this thing is going to make money.\nIn order to do it, you are willing to sell your house and give up everything else. If you have this determination, just do it.\nCurrently, I am still CEO, the chief education officer, of Alibaba. My job is to ensure that people joining my company do better than me and they become better than themselves.\nInternet is a technology that can improve people's lives rather than just make money. This is my belief and mission. If you have a group of people who believe in the dream you guys have together, you will be more likely to succeed.\nCongratulations on your new-born daughter, Mark. I've seen a picture of you holding her with a book. The title is \"Quantum Physics for Babies.\" Is this the starting point for learning?\nZuckerberg: What I really hope her to have is just curiosity. She should go forward and try to learn different things. It is OK no matter what she wants to be, whether a teacher, or a doctor like her mother, or an engineer like me, or anything else. I hope she has curiosity, keeps asking why things are like they are, and how things can be better. That is curiosity.\nMa: The advice to our kids is to be happier, healthier and more optimistic. I don't care what my daughter does, as long as she is happier, healthier and more optimistic at solving any problems. As human beings, we have all kinds of disasters, but we believe we will solve these problem. If we can't, someone will. If somebody can't, we can. We've been working so hard. What we want to do is to make our children live in a world better than ours.\nmasi@chinadaily.com.cn\nJack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd Reuters\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and CEO Reuters\nMark Zuckerberg and his wife holding their newborn daughter.Provided To China Daily\n(China Daily 03\/25\/2016 page15)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/50\/145889245466.jpg\n00221917e13e185ed07016.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/9\/145889245642.jpg\n00221917e13e185ed07317.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/83\/145889245823.jpg\n00221917e13e185ed07618.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/28\/145889245916.jpg\n00221917e13e185ed07919.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/6\/145889246052.jpg\n00221917e13e185ed07a1a.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/57\/145889246224.jpg\n00221917e13e185ed07c1b.jpg\n","603":"China Daily reporters Ma Si, He Wei and Fan Feifei quizzed senior executives from three internet-based businesses that are at the forefront of online innovation.\nFrom left: Han Kun, CEO and founder of Yixia Tech, Cheng Wei, CEO and founder of Didi Chuxing, and Eric Jing, CEO of Ant Financial Services Group.

In the run-up to the event, China Daily reporters Ma Si, He Wei and Fan Feifei quizzed senior executives from three internet-based businesses that are at the forefront of online innovation. Here, Cheng Wei, CEO and founder of ride-sharing firm Didi Chuxing, Han Kun, CEO and founder of video-sharing app Yixia Tech, and Eric Jing, CEO of Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, discuss how the internet is reshaping innovation.\nHow do you view China's role in the global internet arena, and what are the most innovative trends and products?\u00a0\nCheng Wei: In recent years, I've seen so many innovations in China's internet industry. And it has made a huge difference across the world. I believe China will become the online linchpin, leading a number of revolutionary transformations in the sharing economy, transportation and artificial intelligence.\nThe most interesting development is how people take things online and then apply them offline again to change existing industries. The artificial intelligence technology behind ride-sharing is now being used to help taxi companies and bus operators to revolutionize the way they manage drivers, and vehicles.\nTraffic lights have existed for centuries but now Didi scientists are using big data analytics to manage them real time. Technology is not only about expensive gadgets but a life necessity such as affordable, on-demand mobility for everyone.\nThe ability of technology is to bridge gaps and be a force of inclusion rather than exclusion. This is the trend that will carry China and the rest of the world toward a more interconnected and shared future.\nHan Kun: China's internet technology and applications have evolved alongside the rapid development of the country's economy. Our mobile internet technology and apps are currently leading the world. We are also innovators in the internet field.\nThe most innovative products may come from the areas of artificial intelligence, or AI, and mobile video. As AI technology sweeps across the world, countries are introducing new laws and policies to secure the development of this industry. Additionally, mobile videos, especially short ones, have experienced high speed development.\nEric Jing: The so-called \"Copy to China\" model has seen a distinct shift in recent years. In fact, in sectors like fintech, China has the scale and technology to lead innovation globally.\nThe prevalence of mobile payments has unlocked new economic opportunities for people and small businesses. Nowadays, four Chinese consumers in five will tell you that they are comfortable going out with only their smartphones and no cash.\nPeople, including the elderly, buy groceries from street vendors by scanning a printed QR code using their mobile phones. You just don't see this in other parts of the world. In addition to bringing convenience for buyers, mobile payment has also helped street vendors address the long standing issue of fake bank notes. Another area that China is well positioned to compete globally is the application of AI to transform traditional businesses. The tangible benefit of applying AI to services has the power of dramatically increasing productivity. This in turn will give people greater access.\nWhat will be the challenges facing China as it becomes a powerful, friendly internet country?\nCheng Wei: Powerful internet countries have many similar traits, but I think the most important ones are being inclusive and forward-looking. Didi's rapid growth in China proves how important these characteristics can be.\nFor example, when the rest of the world was bickering about whether online ride-hailing and ride-sharing was legal or not, China became the first country to give it the all clear on a national basis. It was a huge step for a country with the vision to see the coming revolution in transport.\nWith ride-sharing, electric vehicles and autonomous driving, China will lead the next wave in transportation across the world.\nHan Kun: As far as I am concerned, internet power should have the following characteristics, such as a large population and a well-equipped network infrastructure. It should also be strong scientifically with innovation capability and a pool of internet talent. A good capital environment is another important part. China has nearly all those characteristics.\nBut the country still needs to grasp the coming opportunities, meet the needs of consumers and sustain innovation.\nEric Jing: A country with a strong internet sector needs many ingredients. China luckily has most of them, such as good internet infrastructure and a vast talent pool for the sector. It also has a large savvy population and a high mobile internet penetration rate, as well as supportive government policies.\nWhen you have all of those ingredients, it is only natural to see cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou become talent magnets globally. The challenge is how you make the overall environment even more attractive to innovation. We need more collaboration between academia and industry to accelerate the process from research and development to application of new technologies. That will be the key to success.\nDo you believe China's experiences, or practices, related to technology and the internet can be used to solve global problems?\nCheng Wei: Yes, of course. China is the world's largest and probably the most complex internet market. Tech companies can gain rich insight and develop advanced technological capabilities here, which will help them go further.\nTake Didi as an example. The intensity of traffic congestions and mobility inefficiency in China is unparalleled. The services we have developed to deal with these problems can be used elsewhere. We have managed to introduce quite a few services, which we have created for China's market, to the wider international communities.\nOur minibus and hitch programs have been adopted respectively by our partners in Brazil and Southeast Asia, where they can perfectly meet local demands.\nHan Kun: Yes, of course. One of the most important experiences gained from China's sustained internet development has been innovation. Whether it is the portal era, the e-commerce era or the era of the shared economy, innovation has always been a driving force for development.\nEric Jing: Definitely. A large percentage of people are underserved in terms of financial services, especially in developing markets. Digital payment systems can greatly reduce the cost of serving customers, especially with basic financial services, such as savings accounts, and even wealth management.\nAnt Financial's technology capability and experience in providing digital financial services in China have stood the test of time and scale. For example, we processed 256,000 transactions per second during the peak of the Singles Day shopping festival. By working with our global partners, we are confident that the same technological capability can be leveraged in other parts of the world to make financial services more inclusive. It will give people equal opportunities.\nIn the past year, what changes in the internet and technology sectors have impressed you, and will they make an impact in the future?\nCheng Wei: One of the greatest revolutions is the integration of the three internets. That is the internet of information, the internet of energy, and the internet of transportation. This revolution is not only the result of technological advancement, but an inevitable choice to change a centuries old unsustainable model of development. Integration will change this.\nCars will not be owned but shared. Energy produced in an eco-friendly way will be connected to a web of charging stations. Transportation will be arranged and deployed on big data-powered platforms. Parking lots will make way for schools and green spaces.\nThe entire landscape of cities will be changed for the better.\nHan Kun: During the past few years, China's internet industry has gone through many changes and innovations. These include online to offline, or O2O, the shared economy, mobile live broadcasts and short video. Changes will affect our future since all of them are based on meeting people's needs.\nEric Jing: Mobile payments moving into more offline areas and covering more geographical regions became an important change this year. The trend will dramatically change our lives and the real economy. We are already seeing rapid growth in the shared economy sector, such as bikes and home stay. And mobile payments are helping this industry grow.\nHow will artificial intelligence improve your business and how will you tap into the technology?\nCheng Wei: Didi caters for 25 million rides a day. Every single one is arranged, deployed and completed by the power of AI. Didi is fully committed to big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can continuously improve the efficiency of our platform.\nEvery day, we process 20 billion routing requests and deal with 15 billion location points. Didi's AI capabilities are based on the enormous amount of data. By analyzing the behavior and locations of our users - both the drivers and the passengers - we are getting better at deploying capacities.\nHan Kun: Artificial intelligence is affecting all industries and Yixia is no exception. We have already been applying this technology on our Miaopai and Yizhibo platforms.\nIn October, we cooperated with SenseTime and Star VC in exploring video advertisements using artificial intelligence and augmented reality in our content. The technology will also be applied to our Miaopai and Yizhibo platforms.\nEric Jing: AI is one of the pillars of our BASIC strategy - namely Blockchain, AI, Security, Internet of Things and Cloud Computing. The technology has tremendous potential to increase productivity, which is something we must continue to improve, so people can access more products and service.\nOur AI capabilities include voice recognition, natural language processing and image recognition. We are already applying and constantly exploring new ways to use this technology in our products and services. For example, our AI powered real-time risk management platform, AlphaRisk, reduces fraud on Alipay with a loss rate of one in 1 million.\nAnother example of an AI application is the intelligent assistant within our Alipay app. It is able to handle interactions with a user by answering questions like a human being.\nIn the next five years, what will be the new internet and technology trends?\nCheng Wei: The integration of three internets, namely the internet of information, the internet of energy and the internet of transportation, will transform the landscape of cities.\nHan Kun: Short video is hot within the internet industry and this trend will continue. With the development of the mobile internet, traditional image-text methods will give way to vivid, short videos. This is because video meets the needs of consumers looking for information.\nThe trend also gives us an advantage as Miaopai is now one of China's most successful short video platforms. According to the latest data from QuestMobile, the leading big data service provider, our monthly user scale has exceeded 310 million for two consecutive months.\nEric Jing: Technologies, such as the internet of things, blockchain and biometrics, are going to expand quickly with wide application. Blockchain allows an online ledger to be open to public scrutiny, creating a level of trust that was not there before.\nWe are already piloting the application of blockchain in areas such as philanthropy and mutual insurance, so as to foster more trust-based growth.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/57\/151218483172.jpg\nb083fe955b6c1b8c5f8842.jpg\n","604":"Amy Barzdukas, executive vice-president and chief marketing officer of unified communications provider Polycom, is a veteran blue chip executive.\nAmy Barzdukas leads Polycom's efforts in China, which is 'an important and ever-changing market'\nAmy Barzdukas, executive vice-president and chief marketing officer of unified communications provider Polycom, is a veteran blue chip executive.\u00a0\nShe worked as a vice-president of worldwide marketing for HP's business personal systems group and had a 16-year career with Microsoft.\nPolycom attracted her the most with its large-enough-to-execute, small-enough-to-impact company size and its ability to provide people with better communication approaches, Barzdukas said.\nShe joined a new executive lineup that includes CEO Mary McDowell and two other female executives. She brought her 20-year experience in the technology industry to Polycom.\nBarzdukas has been to Shanghai and Guangdong before her first visit to Beijing. As a leader of a global company, she explained the reasons of visiting China.\n\"Without doubt, China is really an important and everchanging market for our company. The only way to know the local challenges is to go out and hear directly from the customers and partners about the present situation.\"\nAsked about the challenges of rapid internet penetration, Barzdukas expressed her positive expectations of the Chinese market: \"With the development of 5G (fifth-generation mobile networks), Polycom has been provided with tremendous opportunities to reach more less-developed cities and bring high-quality service to SMEs - small and medium enterprises - in China.\n\"Since the industry is undergoing tremendous digital transformation, we are currently focusing on full utilization of digital marketing.\"\nBarzdukas said Polycom's next goal is to combine artificial intelligence and augmented reality.\n\"Our product is actually using artificial intelligence since it recognizes faces and presents to the other end. Augmented reality would also be strengthened to alter or block the background in our future products.\"\nBarzdukas is positive about Polycom's future. \"We've clear goals and we're on the way. At the end of the day, all that matters is delivering what customers want and we believe we'll succeed in that.\"\nFor a telecoms corporation, Polycom has a relatively high number of female executives - 36 percent while the average is 19 percent, according to the 2016 Women in the Workplace report.\nBarzdukas said that it was a coincidence rather than a deliberate selection: \"It's a statement about the company that it continues to hire people based on their talent and experience instead of their gender. As far as I'm concerned, it's simply the right people being in the right place at the right time.\n\"It's important for an executive team to have diversity in both gender and thinking patterns as well. It helps you to ultimately perform as a team. Our customers are diverse in terms of shape, sex and size, so having a diverse team means we can better respond to their diverse needs.\"\nShe also said that the benefits female executives bring to the job accrue not only to the corporation but the whole society.\n\"It's of crucial importance to let the young generation be aware of what they are capable of doing, since you are mostly inspired by what you see - witnessing women in senior positions makes you understand you can actually realize your dreams.\"\nShe considers being a female executive and the mother of three at the same time the most significant achievement in her life.\n\"Being named CMO at Polycom would definitely be my top career achievement,\" Barzdukas said. \"As a female executive, keeping a work-family balance is also a significant accomplishment.\"\nWith her husband also busy on business trips, it's a huge challenge for Barzdukas to keep a balance between her responsibility to her family and her career. \"We've three kids and two dogs, so it's rather challenging.\"\nBarzdukas shares a story to stress the importance of prioritizing. \"My husband and I once talked about our kids' weekend plans when I was busy preparing for my Polycom presentation. He asked me what I'd want to miss. Frankly speaking, I couldn't bear to miss a single thing.\"\n\"However, I realized since then that lots of my work was self-imposed. I need to choose either devoting to the team and having Polycom remembering my presentation, or having my kids remembering their mom showing up at their game 20 years later.\"\nLi Jiayue contributed to this story\n(China Daily 10\/09\/2017 page15)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/71\/150751015351.jpg\na41f726b05111b44f6e20f.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/36\/150751015477.jpg\na41f726b05111b44f6ec10.jpg\n","605":"A robot has taken the maths sections of China's notoriously difficult national college examination and got 70 per cent of the answers right, state media reported.\nThe AI-MATHS robot, which is about the size of a refrigerator, took the exam paper in a technology park in Chengdu in Sichuan province on Wednesday.\nUnder the supervision of government inspectors, it spent more than 20 minutes to complete the questions ranging from algebra to geometry and achieved a score of 105 out of the total 150, the reports said.\u00a0\nAI-MATHS was built by Zhunxingyunxue, a Chengdu-based cloud computing company jointly owned by Tsinghua University in Beijing.\nChinese poetry scholars 'disgusted' by AI-authored book of poems\nOne of the first - and easiest - questions was, if the complex number (1-i) (a+i) corresponds to the second quadrant in the complex plane, what is the value of the real number (a). The exam robot provided a correct answer, according to teachers who marked the paper.\nAI-MATHS did get stuck on simple sentences, though. It could not understand, for example, what \"the number of teachers was twice more than male students\" meant.\nProfessor Sun Maosong, director of the Natural Language Processing Group at the department of computer science and technology at University, said the performance of the artificial intelligence in the exam exceeded his expectations.\nThe technology could find a use in a wide range of applications, including education and medical diagnosis, he said.\nHowever the robot struggled to understand some language with its subtleties and ambiguities, he said.\nThe exam robot fell far below the level required by top-tier universities in China such as , which usually ask for a score from prospective students of 140 or higher.\nThe machine, however, beat the score of about half the high school students in terms of the understanding and solving mathematical questions, said Sun, who was not directly involved in the project.\nA maths test forms part of the annual national college entrance exam in China, known as the gaokao, one of the toughest of its kind in the world.\nThe robot's score provides a good benchmark to evaluate the recent advances in artificial intelligence against the human mind, according to Sun.\nThe challenge in the exam was not simply mathematics, but also understanding the language used to phrase the questions, he said.\n\"When a robot can achieve 130 or beyond, it may be regarded as truly intelligent, but I'm afraid it will take many, many years of effort to reach that level,\" he added.\n'Be fearless, this is the start of your bright future': Stephen Hawking to China's 9 million students taking entrance exams\nThe robot scored 93 points out of 150 in a similar test in February, lower than the student average of 106, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua.\nLin Hui, the chief executive officer of Zhunxingyunxue, told the news website Thepaper.cn the machine could have performed better.\n\"If we could have an hour and a half, the score could be increased by 10 points or more,\" he was quoted as saying.\nQi Zuhai, one of the three high school teachers who graded the robot's test, told the China News Services he was surprised by the computer's handling of some questions.\n\"There was a three-dimensional geometry question.

AI would not only be utilized for more general purposes in human life, but will also shake up the landscapes of a range of industries from e-commerce to healthcare.\nWhat's behind AlphaGo\nProfessionals and spectators described as \"unorthodox\" many of the moves made by AlphaGo in its first of the three games against Ke Jie on May 23.\n\"There was a 'cut' that stunned me, because human players would never use the move (under that circumstance),\" said Ke Jie in a press conference after the contest. \"But after analyzing the game, I think it's a smart move that killed two birds with one stone.\"\nAI basically relies on algorithms and big data, according to Luo Jiebo, professor of computer science at the University of Rochester. AlphaGo uses a type of search algorithm to find its moves based on the knowledge it previously \"learned\" by a type of AI called deep learning, or neural networks that mimic human learning, through playing a large number of games with both humans and machines.\nThis time, Ke Jie confronted with a newly upgraded version of AlphaGo bettered by reinforcement learning, which enables AlphaGo to sort out the best solution on its own.\n\"AlphaGo has played numerous games. With vast quantities of data, it would quickly learn effective moves,\" said Luo, \"Besides, the machine doesn't have the intuition to defend like a human does. All it wants is to get the maximum rewards... Its calculation is based on an assessment of the interests of the whole situation.\"\nLuo held that owing to deep learning, AI has improved remarkably in its capability to identify visuals and recognize voices after gobbling up a huge mass of data.\nHe added that so far in China, face detection and recognition has been applied successfully in practical terms, which relies largely on the combination of deep learning and big data.\n\"Currently many Chinese companies, big or small, are making face recognition programs. Because of the fierce competition, they have to constantly update their technologies and allow them to appear in our daily life, for example applications used for online banks and for company employees to check in,\" the professor said.\nAI to enter traditional industries\nAI has also been widely applied in various fields from e-commerce to finance.\nAt present, AI researchers are committed to efforts to allow more enterprises and ordinary users to participate in the field of AI by providing practical products and services, Li Feifei, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab and the Stanford Vision, told Xinhua in a recent interview.\nE-commerce giants, such as Amazon and Alibaba, have used a form of machine learning in their online recommender systems to boost sales, which is based on data collected from customers' browsing and purchasing preferences.\nAlibaba will roll out facial recognition payment software in the near future. According to a video demonstrating the payment system, shoppers can complete payment by scanning their faces and imputing the last four digits of their mobile phone numbers.\nMeanwhile, it has been widely acknowledged that global tech giants at the front end of AI exploration have ramped up research and development in AI applications designed to make human life smarter in a variety of fields including health care, autonomous driving and smart robotics.\nOne of the most anticipated sectors is health care. Researchers have claimed that AI software would be likely to serve as an experienced assistant by helping doctors sift through loads of patient information and accumulate clinical data and experience for better disease diagnosis, such as cancer diagnosis and the recognition of magnetic resonance imaging.\n\"In the medical field, AI can learn from cases from around the world, at which it excels. However, a doctor can only gain experience from the cases he has seen, which has limits,\" said Luo.\nElaborating on his blueprint, Li Yanhong, CEO of Chinese internet giant Baidu, predicted that AI would be the \"main course\" for the future, calling the Internet \"the appetizer,\" in a speech during the 2017 Baidu Union Summit held in Southwest China's Chongqing city on May 23.\n\"In the age of AI, machines will be able to understand humans and their intentions, and thus allow humans to communicate all kinds of subjects,\" Li explained during the speech.\u00a0\nJobs on edge or better future\nHowever, it has sparked huge concerns that AI would shake up traditional industries by slashing hordes of jobs.\nAt present, some lenders and financial institutions in the United States have used AI underwriting and loan-distributing machines in replace of humans.\n\"The machines can decide whether and how much to lend, as well as how long the lending would be with a wealth of data,\" said Luo Jiebo, \"The decision made by machines are more accurate and without human bias.\"\nKai-Fu Lee, computer scientist and founder of Sinovation Ventures, had echoed the status quo and made a bold prediction in a commencement speech to Columbia University's engineering department on May 15.\n\"In the next 10 years, all financial companies will be turned upside-down, with AI replacing traders, bankers, accountants, research analysts, and insurance companies,\" he said, \"Last year, my AI investment algorithm returned 8 times more than my private banker.\"\nIn Luo's opinion, although unemployment caused by AI would be inevitable, it should not be viewed negatively because machines are not on the opposite side of humans. \"There must be new jobs turning up. For example, machines need (people) to maintain,\" he said.\nHe gave the example of the use of AI in healthcare. \"AI will make doctors' work easier, as machines process preliminary information. But it is humans who make critical and final decisions,\" he said, \"That's because machines would only consider things that humans order them to.\"\n\"I think the ultimate purpose of AI is not to replace humans, but rather to co-exist with humans and achieve common prosperity, which is the right direction (for the development of AI),\" Luo stressed.\n","607":"For years, we have been warned that the day will come when \u00admachines will be able to do our jobs better than we can.

Developed economies will not be spared either, according to the lender.\n\nIn 2015, Beijing launched its Made in China 2025 initiative, which emphasises intelligent manufacturing supported by the development of industrial robots to make the country a technology superpower.\nDon't fear AI even if bots take jobs, Tencent co-founder says\nDriven by government \u00adpolicies, about 3,000 new robot makers or automation service suppliers emerged from 2014 to 2016, mostly in the Pearl River and Yangtze River deltas, according to the China Artificial Intelligence Robot Industry Alliance.\u00a0\nAI will be 'billions of times' smarter than humans, expert says\nChina invested US$2.6 billion in artificial intelligence companies and start-ups in 2016, ranking second globally in the category. It trailed the US, at US$17.9 billion, but beat Britain's spending of US$800 million, according to data from China's WuZhen Institute.\n\n\"Demographically, China is in two races against time,\" Cai said.\u00a0\n\nFirst, it had to improve \u00adproductivity before the working population declined too fast, and to achieve that, innovation and the adoption of robots were \u00adneeded, he said.\n\n\"Secondly, we have to figure out in what aspects human beings are better than robots - emotional quotient, judgment or creative thinking?\n\n\"Then we can make a plan to compensate the weakest group of people - workers replaced by \u00adrobots and those who will never get another job.\"\u00a0\nChina tops global poll for faith in AI creating jobs, improving lives\nSouth Korea has introduced what is being called the world's first tax on robots - limiting tax \u00adincentives for investment in the \u00admachines over fears they will cause mass unemployment.\n\nCai did not elaborate on how he thought China should tax \u00adrobots, but said the revenue \u00adgenerated should be used to pay for a social security system that would ensure a universal basic \u00adincome.\u00a0\n\n\"This is a pressing issue,\" he said.\n\nIllustration: Brian Wang\n","608":"The assembled cast at this year's two sessions shows how central innovation is to China's development strategy.\nInternational collaboration crucial during 'gold rush' era, expert says\nThe assembled cast at this year's two sessions shows how central innovation is to China's development strategy.\nSome of the most high-profile figures at the ongoing first session of the 13th National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, and the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the top advisory body, are not politicians but entrepreneurs - Baidu's Robin Li, Tencent's Pony Ma, Xiaomi's Lei Jun, and JD's Richard Liu.\u00a0\nThey help to advise the government on the future prospects of China's technological sectors such as telecommunications and e-commerce, as well as new frontiers such as artificial intelligence and autonomous transport.\nThis year's two sessions will provide a crucial blueprint on how innovation can lift people out of poverty and establish China as a world leader in science and technology advancement, said Nathalie Cachet-Gaujard, director of innovation at the China-Britain Business Council.\n\"There has been this rapid takeup of innovation in China. It's exploded exponentially,\" Cachet-Gaujard said. \"AI is advancing very rapidly. The space program and telescope advancements are tremendous achievements. China is expecting to launch the first 5G applications and devices in 2018. And depending on which metrics you are using, China is either just behind or perhaps ahead of the United States in terms of published scientific papers.\"\nCachet-Gaujard said Chinese high-speed rail technology and bike-share programs have gone global, one in three \"unicorns\" - or startups valued at $1 billion or above - is born in China, and the country is now the largest market for electric vehicles.\nCachet-Gaujard, who was a lecturer at Xiamen University in Fujian province and worked in the software and telecom industry in Beijing, said during this \"gold rush\" period of innovation, international collaboration is crucial.\nShe said she hopes the government will look to take a seat at the table in creating international standards for research and managing the development of artificial intelligence.\n\"Increasingly, people are saying there needs to be a context in which AI is developed,\" Cachet-Gaujard said. \"Deciding how humans are going to interact with AI, and how AI is going to be managed is a global issue.\"\nThe internationalization of China's workforce will be key to ensuring China remains on the cutting-edge of AI and other areas of technological enquiry, she said.\nIn his Government Work Report delivered on March 5, Premier Li Keqiang said China would create incentives for Chinese studying abroad to return and incentives to recruit foreign talent.\n\"It's encouraging that China hopes to attract more diverse talent,\" Cachet-Gaujard said. \"In a lot of these new areas, countries will be going after the same talent, so it's going to be very competitive.\"\nThe premier also said the government would look to extend tax policies that benefit angel investment and venture capital, a move Cachet-Gaujard supports. However, she is concerned that limitations on the movement of capital could stymie innovation.\n\"Sometimes, companies in China may not be able to invest as much as they want in companies outside of China,\" Cachet-Gaujard said.\n\"It means that companies invest more in China, which can lead to an overvaluation of companies in China. It also means there is not enough cross-pollination in different markets, which prevents the progress of innovation.\"\nShe said that in order to meet global challenges, countries need to work together.\n\"The global consensus which was set in the G20 Summit in Hangzhou in 2016 is the right way forward,\" she said. \"China staying open and contributing to international collaboration in innovation is going to be key to solving current global challenges.\"\nangus@mail.chinadailyuk.com\nA worker checks the side of a bullet train in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, on Feb 6.

Wuzhen appeared mysterious and energetic indeed.\u00a0\nThe town, known for its waterways, is hosting the World Internet Conference for the third time. And I'm here for a third time to cover the annual event.\nThat has made me a witness to the changes the town has undergone over the years. Those changes have much to do with Wuzhen hosting the annual event. There are many businesses here that are related to the event.\nAs a conference regular, I'm familiar with the nitty-gritty: how to register online for the event, how much extra time is to be reserved to take part in a panel discussion and such. Yet, each conference's topics, focus areas and activities tend to be different, making me feel like a rookie reporter.\nThe conference venue in Wuzhen remains the same, but fresh attractions always cheer me up, encouraging me to keep learning and writing about the new developments.\nIn 2014, the conference host, the Cyberspace Administration of China, announced that the town had been covered with free Wi-Fi, to make it easier for journalists and guests to communicate with the rest of the world.\nBut the benefits of free access to the internet were far-reaching. In a sense, it was a perfect combination of the high-tech and the ancient in this town. For the first time, many industries got an opportunity to further expand their reach through cyberspace.\nThe advance of new communications technologies in this ancient town appears relentless. I'm now accustomed to using nifty network devices here. But then, Wuzhen surprises me every time it hosts the conference with the launch of a large number of high-tech products and online services.\nThis year, smart robots powered by artificial intelligence are demonstrating how they are changing the world and what more contributions they will make to people's lives.\nJiang Yong, founder of itslaw.com, a web-based legal services provider, said the internet seems to be entering a new era as the first step toward connecting various industries online has been completed.\n\"What we'll or should do in the near future is to apply these artificially intelligent products to our life... serve more people,\" Jiang said. \"For example, use the internet in medical care or lawsuits.\"\nItslaw.com's new product, Faxiaotao, is an AI-based legal robot. It can help people and enterprises to seek lawyers by analyzing an attorney's database. \"Similar products will appear, and more related talents, I believe, will help power the internet's second stage of evolution,\" he said.\nIn addition, cyberspace governance has created new hopes, particularly those related to security. The conference has had spirited discussions on China's first Cybersecurity Law, which was adopted earlier this month, and related issues.\nLi Yuxiao, secretary-general of the Cybersecurity Association of China, said the law is a milestone legislation. \"It's gladdening to see the law grows out of nothing.\"\n","610":"Orbotix, a United States-based company co-founded by robotics experts Ian Bernstein and Adam Wilson, may be changing the face of the US$84 billion global toy industry by reinventing the ball. \nThe company's much-acclaimed Sphero, the world's first mobile application-controlled robotic ball and game system, has raised the bar in the industry for the use of artificial intelligence in so-called smart digital toys since it was first introduced in late 2011.  \n\"The first toy most everyone had growing up was a ball. There is something about the shape. With Sphero, you interact in a new way,\" Wilson, the chief software architect at Orbotix, told the                South China Morning Post  during a visit to Hong Kong.               \u00a0\nWith more than 25 apps available on Apple's iOS and Google's Android mobile platforms, Sphero has been mostly used in multiplayer racing games in which users control the devices with their smartphones or media tablets.  Powered by induction charging, Sphero glows in many colours and is waterproof.\n The spherical robot,  about  the size of a standard  tennis ball, can also be used as a controller for on-screen video game play and so-called augmented reality games. Wilson said savvy primary-school children  have also used Sphero to learn basic programming.\n\"The ball is like a universal smart device on which we built all of the technology that we wanted,\" Wilson said. \"Most of the smarts are in the ball. The ball has communications with the app, but it is in full control. \n\"So if the ball thinks there is something going on, it won't listen to the app. It will do what it needs to do, like get in the right position for you in a game. That's very unique for a toy.\"\nWith the first iteration of the device sold out, Orbotix last year unveiled its re-engineered Sphero 2.0, which has improved artificial intelligence capabilities and can travel at speeds of up to 2.13 metres per second in a racing game.  \n\"The first time I drove a Sphero 2.0, I passed out,\" said Wilson, adding that the company expected to sell  twice as many of the toys last Christmas compared with the original version. \nEach Sphero 2.0 toy also has multicolour light-emitting diodes that make it three times brighter to play with than the original. It now also comes with accessories, including two ramps that unfurl  directly from the                 packaging.              \nAt the online Apple Store in Hong Kong, the device sells for HK$998. The Sphero 2.0, which is selling in more than 70 countries, generated well over US$10 million in sales in the recent holiday shopping season.  \nJonathan Foo, director at Revo IT Consulting, which distributes Sphero in Hong Kong, Singapore and on the mainland, said the sophisticated toy showed just how smartphones had become ubiquitous in the lives of people, young and old alike.  \nAmid the emergence of cheap knock-offs, Orbotix has continued to tinker with its toy. At last month's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Orbotix announced a new version called Sphero 2B, featuring two wheels.  \n\"We believe in play,\" Orbotix chief executive Paul Berberian said in a statement. \"That's why Sphero products offer many ways to play. Not just with different apps, but also by inspiring imagination through robots which are completely programmable.\"  \nThe new Sphero 2B, which will be released starting  this autumn with new smart accessories, rolls at speeds of up to 4.27 metres per second. Orbotix plans to sell it for US$100 - less than the original model cost.\nOrbotix was founded in Boulder, Colorado, by Bernstein and Wilson, who both grew up passionate about custom robot development. Bernstein figured there was something lacking in the world of smartphone-controlled devices and saw an opportunity with his friend Wilson. \nThey applied to the mentorship programme at Techstars, a  start-up accelerator that operates in Boulder and other US cities.  \nWilson said the company, which has so far raised US$17 million in funding and has about 38 staff, plans to create more advanced and affordable robotic devices. \nSphero toys are made by an experienced electronics manufacturing contractor with factories on the mainland.\nWilson said he expected the success of Sphero would justify another round of financing, but pointed out that there was more the team at Orbotix could do. \n\"I feel that in the next five years, if we're not acquired, we'll probably do robotics for businesses and aerospace,\" he said.\nIn the next five years ... we'll probably do robotics for businesses\nAdam Wilson, Orbotix\n","611":"The bar to compete in China's highly competitive premium car-hailing market, currently dominated by Didi Chuxing, was just raised after internet giant Baidu entered the fray by agreeing to provide a chauffeur service provider with funding and access to its artificial intelligence technologies.\u00a0\nShouqi Limousine and Chauffeur, a Chinese car-hailing company backed by state-owned transport service group Beijing Shouqi Group, said on Monday it has raised an additional 1.3 billion yuan (US$196 million) from investors including Baidu and Chinese smart electric vehicle maker NIO.\nThe amount includes 600 million yuan from a series B round led by China Minsheng Trust and 700 million yuan from a B+ round led by Baidu and NIO. Shouqi said the latest funding has propelled the two-year-old start-up to \"unicorn\" status - a private company with a valuation of more than US$1 billion.\nDidi Chuxing plans to use this one advantage to crush its rivals in race for self-driving cars\nThe alliance is expected to intensify competition in China's premium chauffeur-driven car market, currently dominated by ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing with an estimated 70 per cent share of rides.\nWei Dong, chief executive of Shouqi Limousine and Chauffeur, said the new investment was more than just a financial deal because Baidu and NIO are expected to help it build a new transport ecosystem that \"combines capital, smart cars, artificial intelligence and quality service.\"\nShang Guobin, deputy director of Baidu's autonomous driving division, said the company invested in Shouqi because it wanted a strong partner to commercialise its autonomous driving technology.\n\"It is still too early to say who will be the winner of China's ride-hailing market, especially with more and more consumers preferring quality chauffeur services,\" said Shang.\nFollowing a strategic partnership inked between Baidu and Shouqi in late October, Wei said the two firms have been working to bring autonomous driving to China's roadways by 2018.\n\"These pilot projects will still have drivers to monitor the car but the idea is to give passengers a taste of what the future of transport would be like,\" he told the South China Morning Post in an interview last week.\nDidi Chuxing, China's Uber, is building countrywide charging network to drive into EV future\nDidi Chuxing, which ranks as the world's second largest start-up with a valuation of US$50 billion, has also been ramping up research into AI and environmentally-friendly mobility technology as it sees autonomous driving and green energy cars as the future of the ride-sharing business. In March the company opened a research lab in Silicon Valley, where it has been hiring local talent to work on technologies such as autonomous driving.\nAccording to consultancy Roland Berger, the size of the premium chauffeur car market in China is expected to grow to 500 billion yuan (US$75 billion) by 2020 from 7.7 billion yuan in 2015 as the service expands to smaller cities and as more consumers are willing to pay extra for better service.\nShouqi said its number of monthly active users has reached 2.4 million, still tiny compared with to more than 25 million per day for Didi Chuxing.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Automated writing software is taking off so quickly in some areas of publishing that the humble human author could soon be replaced by a robot capable of dashing out flash fiction, poetry and novels in a fraction of the time. \nJournalists could be similarly doomed, and the news desk could soon become an even less emotional place. But does anyone actually want to read a newspaper or a novel written by a robot? \u00a0\nWhether or not writers like it, automated writing is coming. Machine translation software is already common and financial reporting is next. \nOne such piece of software is Narrative Science's Quill, which automatically transforms structured data into plain English stories indistinguishable from those generated by humans, and at an unprecedented speed and scale. \"Quill's power lies in the fact that it is a synthesis of data analytics, artificial intelligence and editorial expertise,\" says Kris Hammond, chief technology operator at Narrative Science. As well as an ability to describe, predict and advise based purely on data, Quill has artificial intelligence in the form of a \"natural language engine\". \nAs with any software, Quill is based on algorithmic analysis, though its secret weapon isn't artificial intelligence, but instead a patent-protected use of journalistic \"angles\". It's that which brings it an ability to make distinctions between situations and have a nuanced approach to generating news. \nFor now at least, we're talking about highly structured, financial news that's written purely to inform - not to entertain. \"The only limit on the technology is that Quill can only generate language where there is data to begin with,\" says Hammond. \"While this could, in theory, include textbooks and novels, it is doubtful we will see the technology applied to those problems in the near term. It does, however, already send out Tweets during sporting events.\" \nSo should sports journalists as well as news writers feel threatened by such software? \"No one should be worried about automated writing systems,\" says Hammond. \"As with our technology they are designed for writing into spaces where no one else is writing and working in co-ordination with other writers and analysts.\nSoftware that helps writers has been around for a while. One is NewNovelist, which attempts to ape a creative writing course and includes advice on how to structure a novel into sections, citing examples from well known works. Is that somehow cheating the reader? \n\"Providing the software does not write the prose of a novel then it can't be cheating,\" says Andrew Philpott, product manager at NewNovelist. \"It does contain automatic name generators and the like, but the writer never leaves the driving seat of their novel.\" \nThere are differing levels of creativity at work here, but don't confuse \"automated\" with \"automatic\" writing. The latter is a creative stream of consciousness method famously used by American author Jack Kerouac to write  On the Road (Kerouac called it \"spontaneous prose\", others \"dream writing\"). Can automated writing, which is purely about increasing efficiency and saving time, really shed any light on the human subconscious? \n\"Most automated writing software works by imitating samples from human writing,\" says John Lee, assistant professor in Chinese, translation and linguistics at City University, whose research group is developing an app that helps users compose Chinese poems. \"The application automatically mines word usage and sentence structure patterns from a database of poems from Quantangshi, an anthology of classical Chinese poems written during the Tang dynasty,\" says Lee. \"Based on these patterns, it suggests the next words to the user as he or she composes a poem.\" \nHowever, it's much easier to imitate short poems than novels, explains Lee. To write novels, software must be able to learn word usage, plot development and understand the characters.\nWhether or not a computer could ever write a bestselling novel remains to be seen. \"I believe that stories and novels are a very human thing and based on the human experience,\" says Philpott. \"When someone reads a novel they create a relationship with the author and will spend many hours with them. Would I really want to spend hours with a soulless box of diodes while it tells me a story?\" \nLee thinks that a potential problem with automated writing technology - which might one day bring the prospect of personalised books - is that robots write in low-quality language that's hard to tolerate, let alone enjoy.\n \"It would be most difficult for robots to create texts that require both creative content and high-quality language,\" he says.\n \"Computers may one day be able to write decent novels, albeit ones that sound somewhat like others, but they are unlikely to create true masterpieces.\" \nThe robot's role in the short term will be to help, not replace, the journalist or author, perhaps by writing the first draft that then needs comprehensive editing by a human. \n\"Perhaps one day technology and artificial intelligence will develop sufficiently to allow robots to write meaningful, original, fictional works,\" says Philpott. \n\"However, I think these novels will only be worth reading if robots themselves play a role in our lives as living beings and we share experiences with them.\" \nTo be, or not to be? Now that's a question that ought to vex the first generation of robot writers.\n","613":"Scientists have invented a machine that imitates the way the human brain learns information, a step forward for artificial intelligence, researchers reported on Thursday.\nThe system described in the journal Science is a computer model \"that captures humans' unique ability to learn new concepts from a single example,\" the study said.\u00a0\n\"Though the model is only capable of learning handwritten characters from alphabets, the approach underlying it could be broadened to have applications for other symbol-based systems, like gestures, dance moves, and the words of spoken and signed languages.\"\nJoshua Tenenbaum, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology, said he wanted to build a machine that could mimic the mental abilities of young children.\n\"Before they get to kindergarten, children learn to recognize new concepts from just a single example, and can even imagine new examples they haven't seen,\" he said.\n\"We are still far from building machines as smart as a human child, but this is the first time we have had a machine able to learn and use a large class of real-world concepts - even simple visual concepts such as handwritten characters - in ways that are hard to tell apart from humans.\"\nThe system is a called a Bayesian Program Learning framework, where concepts are represented as simple computer programs.\nResearchers showed that the model could use \"knowledge from previous concepts to speed learning on new concepts,\" such as building on knowledge of the Latin alphabet to learn letters in the Greek alphabet.\n\"The authors applied their model to over 1,600 types of handwritten characters in 50 of the world's writing systems, including Sanskrit, Tibetan, Gujarati, Glagolitic - and even invented characters such as those from the television series Futurama,\" said the study.\nSince humans require very little data to learn a new concept, the research could lead to new advances in artificial intelligence, the study authors said.\n\"It has been very difficult to build machines that require as little data as humans when learning a new concept,\" said Ruslan Salakhutdinov, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Toronto.\n(China Daily 12\/12\/2015 page8)\n","614":"Baidu, the operator of China's dominant online search engine, has lost another top-notch artificial intelligence (AI) expert, the latest blow to the company's effort in making the technology the centrepiece of its business revival plan.\nLin Yuanqing, former head of Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning, whose research focus includes image recognition and human-computer interaction, has confirmed to the mainland media that he had resigned from Baidu in September and will set up his own AI business to \"create big value\" for traditional industries.\u00a0\nLin was unreachable for comment on Friday afternoon. Baidu declined to comment, but numerous sources close to the matter have confirmed of Lin's departure from the company.\nLin's resignation is the latest high-level AI scientist to leave the Beijing-based technology company, which is betting huge on AI to turn around its business that was hit by a regulatory scandal in 2016.\nThe company, listed on Nasdaq, predicted on Friday that its sales will reach between 22.23 billion yuan (US$3.34 billion) to 23.41 billion yuan in the December quarter, falling short of the projected 24.8 billion yuan. Baidu executives had warned investors not to expect near-term gains from its Apollo autonomous car platform or voice assistant DuerOS, which required long-term investments.\n\"Baidu's core search business is under threat by social media and e-commerce companies.

Our smart transportation brain will take care of the rest, telling people what means of transportation to take and which routes to take,\" said Cheng at Didi's annual meeting held in Beijing last week.\u00a0\nDidi is the latest Chinese technology firm that is gearing up to become a major player in smart city products and services, which is a global market that is forecast to be worth US$1.6 trillion by 2020, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan.\nDidi Chuxing looks beyond ride-hailing to help Chinese cities tackle transport challenge\nSmart cities deploy information and communications technology solutions in three or more functional areas of a city government, according to research firm IHS. Examples include mobile and transport, energy and sustainability, physical infrastructure, governance, and safety and security.\nThese initiatives have emerged in response to an increasingly urbanised world dealing with scarce resources, along with the desire to improve efficiency.\nIHS said the implementation of appropriate technologies would allow smart cities to better cope with pressing issues, while allocating resources more efficiently and helping to improve the quality of life for its residents.\nIn China, smart city initiatives will take advantage of future high-speed 5G mobile networks \"to make use of artificial intelligence for public security, traffic management and disaster management\", while the major internet companies introduce more advanced consumer services, according to a report last year from Jefferies equity analyst Edison Lee.\n\"Didi hopes to become the world's biggest one-stop mobility service operator and lead in building new energy car-sharing and smart transport platforms,\" said Cheng at the Didi \"all-hands\" meeting.\nThe company launched last month its integrated solution for smart city traffic management, which harnesses data generated by its platform that compiles roughly 25 million rides per day.\nIts Didi Smart Transportation Brain had a year-long pilot testing in more than 20 cities across China.\nCheng said Didi currently has more than 1,200 traffic lights on \"smart control\".\nHe said the use of AI and big data will help \"empower cities\".\nMajor competition in this field, however, included Baidu, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings - the Chinese internet triumvirate collectively known under the acronym BAT.\nEarlier this month, Baidu launched its partnership with Beijing government authorities to implement intelligent transport management in the Chinese capital's Haidian district.\nAlibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, signed agreement with the government of Malaysia last month to harness big data, AI and cloud technologies to help the country's cities run more efficiently.\nTencent's cloud computing unit has also clinched similar deals with various local governments across China.\nIn terms of implementing a smart transport system, Didi may have the advantage over its rival internet giants in terms of data resources.\nDidi, which took over Uber Technologies' operations in China in 2016, currently has more than 400 million users across the country and records about 25 million rides per day.\n'China's Uber' ramps up AI arms race, says it will open third deep learning research lab\nDidi, which counts Apple, Alibaba and Tencent among its biggest shareholders, has also developed a global ride-hailing business amid its investments and technology alliances with Uber's US rival Lyft, Southeast Asia's Grab, Ola in India, Brazil's 99, Taxify in Estonia and Careem, a ride-hailing operator in the Middle East and North Africa region.\n\"We believe that not only users and vehicles will be connected online, but also all roads and traffic lights. Transport management will also be part of this online network and become more intelligent,\" said Cheng.\nValued at US$56 billion after its latest funding round in December, Didi started five years ago operating out of a rented flat in Beijing. It was a time when only 20 per cent of the city's taxi drivers had smartphones, according to Cheng.\n\"In the past, no one truly believed Didi would become a player in smart transport, but now the reality is that most overseas institutions refer to us as a leading smart transport solution provider for this day and age,\" he said.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

Its propellers are fully enclosed in carbon fibre, allowing users to grab the device in mid-air and fly it in enclosed spaces without fear of hurting anyone close by.\n\nAnd unlike drones that track users using stereo vision - defined as the perception of depth obtained by comparing visual information from two vantage points - the 242-gram flying device employs computer vision for facial recognition, thereby allowing it to lock on to a specific user and follow them around.\n\n\"The Passport can track you from the front, the side or from \u00adbehind,\" Wang said. \"[With the artificial intelligence software], it actually recognises objects in its view. It'll draw boxes around every face it sees and you can double-click on which person it should follow. None of the other drones can do that.\"\n\nThe Passport can also orbit around the user and spin 360 degrees to capture a panoramic photograph. Users who prefer to control its flight path can do so with an accompanying mobile app.\n\nBut the Passport is not without competition. The device goes up against DJI's Mavic Pro, a US$749 foldable camera-drone that the Shenzhen-based firm launched last month.\n\nThe 734-gram Mavic Pro, which weighs almost three-times the Passport, has obstacle avoidance, a feature the Passport does not yet have. It also boasts almost three times the Passport's 10-minute battery life.\n\n\"I do wish we could have improved the battery life more,\" Wang said. \"We promised eight minutes when we showcased our prototype in April, and now we can go 10. That's 25 per cent better, but we're not going to pat ourselves on the back.\"\n\nBut while Zero Zero Robotics currently only has one device in its portfolio, Wang made it clear that he had more ambitious plans ahead for the company.\n\n\"We want to do so much more in the personal robotics space,\" he said, adding that the Passport was a first step towards more robots the company planned to build.\n\nWang's vision of a personal robotics system at home starts with an aerial command centre - an eye in the sky, which issues commands to other devices around the home.\n\n\"Once a device is airborne above 1.5 metres, there are very few indoor obstacles - perhaps several humans and some pillars. Mobility becomes a lot easier when you can manipulate yourself in a 3-D [setting] ... there is a better view, better path-planning. Obstacle avoidance becomes easier,\" he said.\n\nA smart drone could easily give commands to robots on the ground that \"don't have to get very smart\", Wang said. \"It just has to do what it does on the ground very, very well. The [airborne device] can be the one to plan out the path for the ground robot and tell it what obstacles it has to avoid.\"\n\nHe added that the next-generation Hover Camera Passport, which he expects to release in about a year, would be a lot smarter. \"[The device] is going to be completely autonomous. It will be able to land and charge itself, and then automatically take flight and avoid obstacles while circling around a room,\" he said.\n","621":"Even the best AI cannot match human intelligence, which is unique in accumulating experience and thinking creatively and independently.\nThe world's top Go player Lee Sedol (R) puts his first stone during the last match of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match against Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo in Seoul, South Korea, in this handout picture provided by Google and released by Yonhap on March 15, 2016.[Photo\/Agencies]\nGoogle Deep Mind's AlphaGo artificial-intelligence program has beaten South Korean Go master Lee Sedol 4:1, sparking a debate world wide on whether AI could pose a threat to humankind.\u00a0\nThe development of AI began decades ago. In 1997, Deep Blue developed by IBM defeated the world chess champion Garry Kasparov. In 2010, Apple added Siri (speech interpretation and recognition interface) to its iPhone, which understands the users' audio commands and replies accordingly-similar examples include Xiaobing of IBM and Jimi of jd.com.\nBut Siri, Xiaobing and Jimi can only deal with a limited number of questions, as they compare the user's command with those pre-installed in their \"memories\" and answer accordingly. The Deep Blue, on the other hand, relies heavily on fast computing; it decides its next move in a chess game mainly by evaluating the condition on the chessboard and comparing it with the manuals saved in its \"memory\". That's why it cannot win a Go game, which involves many more possibilities than chess.\nAlphaGo, in this sense, is a big step forward because it uses multi-layered artificial neural network, or ANN, and reinforcement learning alGorithm, which can more exactly imitate the way a human brain thinks. AlphaGo repeatedly observes the Go board, analyzes it with its processor and makes the best choice. More importantly, it can store the decisions in its \"memory\" for future references. In other words, it can more efficiently \"learn\" and improve.\nANN has become a hot subject of research since the 1980s. It is already being used in many fields besides games. For example, the driverless car developed by Google \"observes\" the environment through sensors, using calculations to judge how things are moving, and chooses its route accordingly.\nAlphaGo marks another step forward because the ANN it uses has more than 30 layers thanks to developers and faster computers. Each layer has multi-parameters that get adjusted each time it obtains information from the outside world, a process through which AlphaGo constantly optimizes its strategy. The more information it gets, the more exactly it can adjust the parameters to suit new situations.\nMany people jocularly say AlphaGo is a hardworking student that \"studies\" hundreds of manuals every night. That may be a joke, but AlphaGo has learned a great deal about Go, or it couldn't have defeated Lee Se-dol. Let's hope its victory would make more people interested in AI research.\nYang Feng is an associate professor at the School of Automatics, Northwestern Polytechnical University.\nAI research to boom\nAlphaGo's victory in Go is good news for artificial intelligence as well as human intelligence. Its victory means AI is improving fast thanks to human intelligence.\nAlphaGo's performance is likely to start a global wave in AI research, which would help AI to play a bigger role in sectors such as medicine, education and manufacturing.\nBut AlphaGo's victory has also raised concerns that AI might eventually control, even enslave humans, as depicted in some science fiction movies. Such concerns are unnecessary, at least for the time being. Even the best AI cannot match human intelligence, which is unique in accumulating experience and thinking creatively and independently. Also, scientists are far from clear how exactly the human brain functions. So how can there be a perfect imitation of the human brain? The greatest advantage of AI is its computing speed, which far surpasses that of humans. But it can learn and improve its strategies, not think independently. Machines running on AI can only execute the orders given to them and they seem to be doing it well.\nHowever, AI may be a cause for concern for us as individuals. AI may not be able to conquer the entire human race, but AI-propelled machines have been performing better than humans in sectors other than Go and chess as well. For instance, Foxconn has long been using robots on its assemble lines, while Google and Apple are testing unmanned vehicles. Since AI could replace humans in sectors that require repetitive manual labor in the future, the sense of urgency among workers is understandable. But that is no reason for China to fall behind in innovative technology R&D.\nZhang Zhouxiang is a writer with China Daily. zhangzhouxiang@chinadaily.com.cn\n","622":"Global trade in food and luxuries has been going on for centuries, but the next big commodity looks set to be invisible, yet essential. As we change how we react with each other and the world around us, artificial intelligence is destined to become far more than a future-gazing distraction for geeks and scientists. \n\"AI is going to be a commodity, available on mobiles and computer terminals,\" says technology analyst Peter Cochrane, \"It may well be the most vital of all commodities, surpassing water, food, heat and light. Without it, we will certainly not survive as a species.\" \u00a0\nOne of our problems is data - masses of it. A few hundred years of scientific inquiry and the invention of the data-generating and sharing mechanism that is the internet has left reams of crucial information unused and unanalysed. \nMedical teams need to process and cross-reference both personal data and that from previous patients and studies, while financiers find it ever harder to wade through enough data to make coherent predictions of movements on the stock exchanges.\nWhat these industries need - and will get - is \"machine learning\" from cloud-based computers capable not just of spotting trends in data but making predictions and learning from conclusions. AI is not about sentient robots, but machines that mimic our organic intelligence by adapting to, as well as recognising, patterns in data. AI is about making machines understand. \nWatson is such a supercomputer. Comprised of at least 90 servers and 16,000 gigabytes of RAM, Watson - developed by IBM - can process the equivalent of a million books per second. And using revolutionary smart learning software called DeepQA, Watson can interpret the meaning of questions. So what makes Watson different to other supercomputers? \"Hardware-wise, there's not much,\" says Cochrane. \"It's the more than 300 algorithms it uses which makes the difference.\"\nThere are hundreds of other supercomputers, but none are as good as Watson - not by a long way. \nApplications like Watson represent the latest benchmark of computing power, but the era of artificial intelligence as a whole began long ago. Most of us use it each time we punch a few words into a search engine. \n\"AI has been out there as a commodity for some time,\" says Steve Furber, the ICL Professor of Computer Engineering at the University of Manchester in Britain. \"Google is built on AI as the foundation of its business; it's just not artificial 'common sense'.\" In dividing up your search terms and cross-referencing them with webpages to bring you the most relevant, ranked results, Google processes 24 petabytes (1,000 terabytes) of data per day, and it does so using top secret algorithms. \nA few months ago Google X Labs announced it had developed a nine-layer neural network that could detect faces; a total of 16,000 computer cores spent three days sifting through 10 million random images on YouTube, recognising faces despite not being told what a face was. It even managed to tell the difference between human faces and cat faces. \nThis apes how the brain processes data, by creating a neural network that gets better at identifying links and relationships the more data it receives. It is like a student, whose analytical powers increase with more tutoring. \nThe kind of contextual image recognition achieved in the labs is already being used by Google to refine results in Google Voice. The most striking change is the trend to mobile web searching; the Pew Internet Project reports that about a quarter of US citizens go online using mostly a smartphone. \nDespite the prevalence of the touch screen, interacting with computers by speaking to them is more convenient, and is destined to take over once accuracy increases. \nApple and Android smartphones already have this with Siri and Google Voice and there are third-party apps, such as Evi. \"Siri and Evi are open text query systems that perform similar functions with lower performance (than Watson), but more applicability,\" says Furber.\nEvi has been installed on more than a million mobile devices. \"Apps such as Evi are taking AI into the mainstream,\" says its British inventor William Tunstall-Pedo. \"Evi has a huge knowledge base she can understand and reason with,\" he says. Evi contains almost one billion facts. \"This knowledge includes common sense about the world that was previously limited to human beings,\" he says.\nAs well as sending SMS using spoken commands, Evi will answer just about any question using a mix of its own database and the wider web, although it won't yet give tailored financial predictions. Nor does it learn about individual users. Could we all soon strike-up a conversation with a supercomputer like Watson instead? \n\"There is no obvious reason why Watson could not be deployed in a similar manner to raise the standard of the 'common sense' aspects of these systems,\" says Furber. \"Within 10 years we'll all have access to it.\"\n","624":"Guangzhou Summba Information Technology Co Ltd focuses on semantic analysis, a technology capable of not only analyzing the meaning of words but also \"understanding\" the real demands of a wide range of customers and applications.\u00a0\nSummba introduced an intelligent voice control system in 2016 that could be used in kitchens.\nIf you uttered the phrase \"the fried egg is burning!\" the control system would automatically turn up the stove's extractor fan and lower the heat, said Shi Zhongmin, CEO of Summba.\n\"In the future, AI products will be linked closely to our everyday life, and because of the huge scope of potential applications, machines will need super brains in order to understand the sheer range of language they will be hearing and processing,\" Shi said.\nGuangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, has placed heavy emphasis on the development of AI, making it one of its three strategic emerging industries. The local government has earmarked an annual fund of up to 50 million yuan ($7.27 million) for AI development, according to the Guangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission.\nThe local government has also supported the city's universities and enterprises in the research and development of AI technology.\nThe South China University of Technology focuses on the research of intelligent computers used in the automobile, agriculture, security, healthcare and wearable devices industries, among others.\n\"The development of the artificial intelligence industry needs a core algorithm, as well as cloud computing and big data from various industries\", said Du Lan, deputy senior CEO of iFly Tek, a technology company which has operations in Guangzhou.\n\"Guangzhou, as a city with about 2,000 years of commercial civilization, is very open-minded when it comes to introducing such technology to its industries,\" she said.\n\"It has a complete AI industrial chain and a whole host of trained professionals.\"\nChina's AI market is expected to be worth 100 billion yuan by 2018, according to the Three-Year Plan (2016-18) for the Artificial Intelligence Industry released by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Office of the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs in May 2016.\nAt this year's two sessions in March, AI was included in the Government Work Report for the first time.\n(China Daily 03\/28\/2017 page5)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/51\/149070020015.jpg\n00221917e13e1a43e95a06.jpg\n","625":"After the AlphaGo computer program from Google's parent Alphabet beat China's top Go player Ke Jie three for three in May last year, the 19-year-old was in tears, declaring his opponent \"God-like\". Chinese authorities had earlier cancelled planned live broadcasts of the deciding matches.\nTwo months later, China's State Council announced an ambitious national programme to overtake the United States in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030.\u00a0\nCoincidence? Perhaps, but it is easy to see how the prospects of losing the AI race to the Americans would scare the wits out of Beijing.\nChina's AI pronouncement has since been called a new Sputnik moment for Washington - a wake-up call akin to the 1957 launch of the first space probe by the former Soviet Union, which pushed the Americans to double down on military and aerospace technology, and culminated in the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969.\nLeaders from Russian president Vladimir Putin to Tesla founder Elon Musk have said whoever wins the AI race will \"rule the world\". But there are two races - a 400-metre hurdle to develop human-like AI, or artificial general intelligence (AGI), and a 42-kilometre marathon to discover artificial super intelligence that surpasses the best human brains in virtually every field.\nIn the meantime, the warm-up is \"narrow AI\", which has already been developed by Chinese and American companies to do specific tasks, ranging from autonomous driving to teaching children their ABCs.\nUntil AGI is realised, each country will dominate in the narrow AI fields that play to their strengths. Chinese AI start-ups like Yitu Technology and iFlyTek are at the leading edge of facial and voice recognition, respectively - applications embraced in Communist-ruled China, but resisted by privacy advocates in the US. And as the world's strongest military power, the US is likely to dominate in AI applications for drones and robots.\nAI experts believe the US, led by Alphabet and its London-based DeepMind AI research unit, is ahead in developing AGI, which is the race China is throwing its weight behind now, but may be too far behind to catch up in time.\nWorld's most populous country lacks the one thing it needs to become an AI powerhouse: enough talented people\nIn terms of investment, US$2.6 billion of capital has flowed into China's AI sector in the four and a half years to June, only one-seventh of the amount going into the US, according to research by Wuzhen Institute and NetEase.\nThere is a good chance, however, that China could win the AI marathon given the country's sheer size (population and economy) and its stamina for playing the long game, a characteristic lacking in the US where policies can change after every presidential election.\nMost AI experts believe a breakthrough in super intelligence is decades away at best, if at all, in our lifetimes.\nChina scours the globe for talent to transform into world leader in artificial intelligence and big data\nWinning the marathon, however, would be a Pyrrhic victory for China and the ruling Communist Party, which does not tolerate dissent of any kind. Consider why Chinese censors routinely ban supernatural stories from television and movies - because they convey the idea of powerful forces that cannot be controlled by the party.\nLast year, an AI-powered chatbot was pulled from a Chinese web platform after it gave inappropriate answers. Question: What is the Chinese dream? Answer: To live in America.\nOops. Better not try that with a superintelligent AI, which would view the smartest humans in the room the same way we view apes today.\nStill, knowing that the Americans - not to mention Russians, Israelis and Canadians - are in the same race for super intelligence, Beijing must compete to win even at the risk of unleashing a power it cannot control.\nWhat exactly could a superintelligent AI do that could enable its inventor to rule the world? AI experts agree that its first task will be designing a much smarter version of itself. Then anything is possible.\nInvent a new low-cost, clean energy source. Check.\nDevise a strategy to disable an opponent's military superiority. Check.\nImprove medical care to extend the life of the country's leaders. Check\nScary stuff if you do not trust the machine. That is why AI experts talk about the \"god-slave\" scenario, in which the first to develop artificial super intelligence will keep it \"locked up\" for fear of losing control - something a totalitarian government is more likely to do than, say, a Google.\nPutting aside the question of why such a superior intellect could not escape from human-imposed confines in the first place, such a strategy would limit its capabilities against an equivalent super intelligence from other nations.\nIf China wins the marathon but embraces the god-slave approach, Beijing will effectively be ceding the race to the runner up.\nWho then rules the world? Perhaps the opposing super intelligent entities can compete in a Go match.

Therefore, a number of information technology related jobs will be created in the process. Businesses in other sectors have also invested in more IT positions to drive growth.\nWith the boom of e-commerce in China, consumers are increasingly shopping online. Therefore, traditional retail companies have been reducing headcount recently and even shutting down their operations in China. As this trend is expected to continue in 2017, people who used to work in traditional retail businesses, especially those in the luxury sector, will enter the e-commerce sector.\nCandidates with digital marketing and sales experience will be highly pursued this year, according to Morgan McKinley.\nCui Libiao, researcher of Hangzhou-based China E-commerce Research Center, said: \"Candidates with operational experience are the most urgently needed at e-commerce companies, while marketing talent are also in short supply. As the industry is still expanding rapidly, the candidate shortage is still quite serious.\"\nMeanwhile, a large number of companies specializing in artificial intelligence have been created lately. These companies are actively pursuing individuals with such expertise, according to Morgan McKinley.\nThe latest job ad posted by internet giant Baidu Inc shows that the company is looking for artificial intelligence talent for the man-computer conversation, maps and autopilot businesses.\nAnother industry leader Tencent Holdings Ltd has also been searching lately for talent specializing in AI product planning, AI machine learning and AI research engineers.\nOn the other hand, some companies will remain cautious this year when it comes to recruitment plans in supporting departments, such as finance, accounting or human resources, according to the Chinese Mainland Salary Guide 2017 - a report released by the international employment agency Morgan McKinley in mid-February.\nRio Goh, managing director of Morgan McKinley China, said: \"When economic growth slows down, it is not unusual to see companies adopting a cautious attitude when it comes to hiring or reducing hands.\"\nOwing to cost cutting and operational consolidations, foreign banks started reducing headcount in China and the wider Asia-Pacific region since the second quarter of 2016. In 2017, these banks will remain cautious about hiring.\nAlthough Chinese banks are hiring more than their foreign counterparts, they have also felt the effect of tough business conditions and lower margins. So, some of them are scaling back recruitment or even restructuring and making redundancies.\nEmployee downsizing has already started in leading commercial banks in China. According to the interim report of China Merchants Bank released in late June 2016, its headcount dropped to 68,424 from 76,192 one year earlier.\nSimilarly, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China reported a headcount of 458,711 at the end of June last year, reducing its workforce by 7,635.\nSong Chen, a consumer finance account manager at a commercial bank in Beijing, was told recently that he might be transferred to a community branch, and no longer be responsible for consumer finance.\nSong said: \"If I'm transferring from a previously well-known position to a less familiar one, my salary, bonus, and even annual target would change.\"\nMultinational companies this year will restrict themselves to replacement hires when it comes to accounting and financial roles. They may even choose not to fill vacancies after some staff members leave, expecting the rest of the team to pick up the workload, according to Goh.\nSimilarly, as a support function, human resources teams, especially those within the multinational companies, are expected to be leaner and more efficient. Traditional industries, such as consumer goods, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals are likely to make fewer hires in human resources in 2017, added Goh.\nshijing@chinadaily.com.cn\nJobseekers talk with representatives of an employer at a job fair in Beijing in Feb 2017.

Users can use voice to control lighting, thermostat, home appliances, garage shutter and even security systems.\nAndrew Ng, Baidu Inc's chief scientist, said: \"As speech recognition accuracy goes from 95 percent to 99 percent, all of us in the room will go from barely using it to using it all the time.\"\nAccording to comScore, 50 percent of all searches will be voice searches by 2020.\n(China Daily 02\/23\/2017 page15)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/95\/148784732490.jpg\nf04da2db11221a186e0417.jpg\n","629":"The future is already here - and there is no going back.\nLooking like the main characters Neo and Trinity from the dystopian science fiction film franchise\u00a0The Matrix, police at a railway station in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou scan the crowd in search of wanted criminals using Google Glass-style eyewear with facial-recognition software.\nThis group represents the first wave of police officers in China equipped with such smart glasses, allowing them to screen passengers as part of the tightened security amid the upcoming Lunar New Year travel rush, the busiest travel period of the year in the country.\u00a0\nThey are also the latest example of how China is moving ahead of the rest of the world in making facial recognition technology a part of people's everyday life.\nFacial recognition systems, which are biometric computer applications that identify a person based on a database of digital images, have been extensively used by Chinese authorities for security purposes to spot suspected criminals and even jaywalkers.\nChina's big brother: how artificial intelligence is catching criminals and advancing health care\nUsing sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms, Chinese technology companies and other major businesses have adopted facial recognition systems in the retail, travel and banking environments.\u00a0\nThose include Ant Financial Services Group's \"smile to pay\" application used at fast-food chain KFC; the \"face as boarding pass\" capability that online search provider Baidu plans to roll out at Beijing main airport; and China Merchants Bank's facial recognition-based automated teller machines.\u00a0\nAt the pace China is adopting the technology, the country could be well on its way to becoming one of the world's biggest markets for facial-recognition systems.\nThe global market for facial-recognition software and services is forecast to be worth US$6.5 billion in 2021, up from an estimated US$2.3 billion in 2016, according to research firm Technavio.\nAt the Zhengzhou East high-speed rail station in the capital of Henan province, the police can verify the identities of passengers and spot suspected criminals within two to three minutes - all from a distance of five metres - as their smart glasses are hooked up to a portable device that each officer carries as a means to connect with the police database.\nIn China, these facial-recognition glasses are helping police to catch criminals\n\"The adoption of the glasses represents a breakthrough in security as the police force shifts from being manpower intensive to technology-powered,\" Xie Yukun, a railway police officer in Zhengzhou, said in an interview.\u00a0\nThe smart glasses' ability to operate over a distance is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of police in the railway station during the Lunar New Year holiday, when the biggest annual human migration sees about three billion trips of all kind made within a six-week period through mid-March.\n\"They don't need to make contact, ask for people's ID cards or invite them to their office to gather more information,\" said Xie. \"As soon as they are suspicious about someone, they use the glasses to take a clear picture that shows the frontal view of at least 70 per cent of the person's face, then the system will run it through the database and give a result in two to three minutes.\"\u00a0\nSince the deployment of police with smart glasses started at the Zhengzhou station earlier this month, as many as seven people suspected of crimes, ranging from human trafficking to hit-and-run incidents, had been apprehended.\u00a0\nAlthough Chinese citizens have raised concerns about privacy protection, China's broader initiative to become a global leader in artificial intelligence has prompted local governments and police departments across the country to embrace facial recognition technology as an important tool for public safety efforts.\nIn 2013, Google responded to privacy concerns in the United States by barring any facial recognition feature to be used in Google Glass.\u00a0\nChinese school uses facial recognition system to ensure even forgetful kids get fed\nSuch concerns overseas have not slowed down the advanced implementation of facial recognitions in China.\nIn 2015, the Ministry of Public Security launched a project to build the world's most powerful facial recognition database to identify any one of China's more than 1.3 billion citizens within three seconds. The agency is developing that system with a security company based in Shanghai.\nThe goal is for the database to match someone's face to their ID photo with about 90 per cent accuracy.\u00a0\nWhile it remains unclear whether use of that database could be extended to commercial activities, recent developments show that such a demand is likely to increase over time.\nShanghai, for example, has sought to make life easier for the millions of commuters on one of the longest and busiest mass-transit railway networks on the planet by bringing in voice and facial recognition systems developed by Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the\u00a0South China Morning Post.\nAlibaba, its affiliate Ant Financial and the Shanghai Shentong Metro Group, the operator of the Shanghai Metro, plan to install the Alibaba-developed \"far-field\" voice recognition technology in ticket machines in all stations, as well as a facial recognition system at the entrance of stations to verify the identities of commuters.\nPassengers would be able to tell their destination to ticket machines, and the machines would then recommend the best route. It is a system that would need a vast database to match the identities of commuters.\nChina's Airbnb to introduce check-ins using facial recognition\nHome-sharing start-up Xiaozhu, China's answer to Airbnb, will use the peak travel season of Lunar New Year to test smart locks that can be opened by scanning tenants' faces, which would satisfy laws requiring identify verification.\nThe anticipated wide commercial roll-out of advanced 5G mobile networks across China from 2020 would also mean increased demand to link such a national facial recognition database to various commercial enterprises, which instantaneously push and retrieve biometric information as part of their services. These could include platforms related to autonomous transport, financial services, social media and health care.\nCopyright (c) 2018. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

Holo technology has supported major companies, including L'Oreal and Time, in the areas of training and advertisement, it said.\n\nThe 8i team includes experienced recruits from Weta Digital, Pixar, Hong Kong-listed Digital Domain, YouTube, Nvidia, PayPal, Microsoft Research, Sony Computer Entertainment, Industrial Light & Magic and Valve Corp.\n\nBaidu Ventures chief executive Liu Wei said: \"We look forward to exploring the grand artificial intelligence era with all the parties involved, including entrepreneurs, investors, corporate partners.\"\n\nHSBC analysts Tsang Chi and Wang Qin described Baidu in a report last month as \"the artificial intelligence leader in China\", with core competencies in image and voice recognition.\n\nAI is also used by Baidu for its autonomous driving initiative.\n","631":"'Search Dog' looks to sell about 10% of its shares, probably by end of year\nChina's third-biggest search engine expects to hold a U.S. initial public offering at a valuation of as much as $5 billion as it raises cash to close the gap with leader Baidu Inc in the mobile market.\nSogou, whose name means \"search dog,\" plans to sell about 10 percent of its shares in an IPO that will probably be held this year, Chief Executive Officer Wang Xiaochuan said in an interview. The company, which is backed by social media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sohu.com Inc., hasn't formally hired banks to run the listing. A Sohu spokesperson said a Sogou IPO is \"not on the agenda\" right now.\u00a0\nWhile Baidu remains the biggest provider across all platforms in China, it's under siege after a scandal over medical advertising as smaller rivals including Sogou and Qihoo 360 Technology Co win mobile users. Wang plans to use part of the IPO proceeds to improve search results by backing companies developing artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies.\n\"Over the past year, we've seen a trend where people are finding themselves not trusting Baidu as much and some are even seeking a replacement,\" he said at the company's Beijing headquarters. \"So over the next year or two, as more people feel more comfortable with Sogou they'll realize it is able to replace Baidu.\"\nSohu shares rose 3.9 percent to $35.20 at 9:33 a.m. in New York. They are down 39 percent over the past year.\nBaidu accounted for 44.5 percent of mobile search queries in the third quarter, while Alibaba Group Holding Ltd-backed Shenma had 20.8 percent and Sogou was third with 16.2 percent, according to research from iiMedia.\nOther independent researchers including Analysys International reported that Sogou was China's second-largest provider of search engine services to the country's mobile users. A Sogou spokeswoman said that according to some surveys it's the second-biggest search provider overall.\nWang said Sogou can match Baidu in mobile search within three years. Baidu declined to comment.\nMarie Sun, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service, said Wang's emphasis on artificial intelligence was the correct strategy as search engines around the world adopt the technology to improve results. Still, Baidu has a massive advantage in machine-learning given its history of dominance and access to data.\n\"The problem is I don't think they have that much data -- Baidu has a lot more data,\" said Sun. \"If you don't have the data, then you can't expect your machine to learn as fast.\"\nSogou, which merged with Tencent's Soso search business in 2013, is counting on partnerships with investors and smartphone makers to win market share.\nSogou is the only search engine formally allowed to trawl through public messages on Tencent's WeChat platform, which has more than 800 million users. It's also signing deals with device makers to ensure more smartphones are shipped with its software already installed, adopting a successful strategy used by microblog Weibo.\nWhile Tencent owns a substantial stake in Sogou, the search company is run as a subsidiary of Sohu.com thanks to a dual-class share structure. Wang said the relationship between its main backers is strong but both sides were still discussing how the ownership structure would change once Sogou is listed.\n\"We'd float about 10 to 12 percent,\" Wang said of the expected IPO. \"After the listing I'd estimate we'd reach $4 to $5 billion.\"\nTencent didn't respond to an e-mailed request for comment while calls to the mobile phones of its spokeswoman weren't answered.\nSogou's IPO plans come at a complicated time for search companies in China.

Over the last four to five years, more than 50 million new jobs, or around 10 million annually, have been created in the country, a remarkable achievement of the government's endeavor to promote mass entrepreneurship and innovation, which, as Li said, has seen 14,000 new enterprises registered each day over the past three years.\nBy helping foster a rapid development of new industries and business models, such as e-commerce, mobile payments and the building of a sharing economy, technology and innovation are playing a key role in China's bid to upgrade and transition its economy to more sustainable growth. China can share that experience with the political and business leaders from other countries attending the meeting.\nThe new growth momentum not only created 70 percent of all new jobs in the country last year, it also laid a firm foundation for China to realize its growth target of around 6.5 percent for the year.\nSuch robust economic performance is a boon to the world economy that is still suffering from insufficient recovery momentum.\nAnd as Li noted in his speech, the Chinese economy will bring more opportunities to the world and continue to be a magnet for foreign investment as it further opens up.\nThis, together with his pledge to give foreign and Chinese businesses fair and equal treatment, will surely contribute to global inclusive growth if, as he urged, countries seek convergent interests and complement each other's advantages.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/91\/149860402047.jpg\n00221917a33e1abd1ebc01.jpg\n","633":"Artificial\u00a0intelligence (AI) program AlphaGo will compete with China's best Go players, including Ke Jie, Google announced in Beijing on Monday.\nKe Jie, the world's top Go player, speaks at a press conference in Beijing on April 10, 2017.

The results show that\u00a076.3 per cent see certain forms of AI as a threat to their privacy, even as they believe that AI holds much development potential and will permeate different industries. About half of the respondents said that they believe AI is already affecting their work life, while about a third see AI as a threat to their jobs.\u00a0\nAnxiety has risen over how intrusive AI will be and if they will steal jobs away from humans as companies increasingly deploy the technology, from recommending videos and songs to replacing cashiers with facial recognition and mobile payments. The World Bank estimates that three out of four jobs in China can be replaced by automation by 2030.\nThe CCTV-Tencent survey findings reinforce the view that Chinese consumers are becoming more aware and vocal about their privacy and how their personal data is used. The conventional wisdom up to recently has been that Chinese users care little about privacy, that they accept the trade-off of giving up a large amount of personal data in return for the convenience provided by services that rely on that data.\nNo need to fear AI even if bots take most jobs, Tencent co-founder says\nOn the mainland, everything from registering a mobile phone number to posting on microblogging site Weibo, or signing up for mobile payments service WeChat Pay, requires users to go through an identity verification process. Recent events suggest that consumers are demanding more transparency from China's technology giants on the way they handle their personal data.\nTencent's WeChat messaging unit said in January it did not spy on user conversations nor retained records, after Li Shufu, the founder and chairman of carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, reportedly said that Tencent chairman Pony Ma Huateng \"is watching us through WeChat everyday because he can see whatever he wants\".\nAnt Financial in January apologised for making the opt-in to its Sesame Credit third-party commercial credit scoring service the default when users opened a new report in its app, a move that angered some users who felt the company was misleading them into handing over their data.\u00a0Baidu, the operator of China's largest online search engine, was accused by a Chinese consumer rights protection group of collecting personal information without obtaining users' permission.\u00a0\nChinese tech giants struggle with data privacy as they seek to crack US market\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said Baidu, Ant Financial and Beijing ByteDance Technology, which runs popular news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, had been negligent in telling users about how collected personal data is used, following a series of media reports about how the services operated by those three companies have misled users and violated their privacy.\nIn addition, the regulator said it will monitor the policies of the companies, warning them of severe punishment for any violations.

Users can place the sensor under the pillow.\nWhen users are unable to sleep, they can press the button to play sounds automatically suggested by experts, which will help users fall asleep.\nLi Yizhou, founder and CEO of Shiwu Technology, said the factors that affect sleep include changes in light, temperature and sound. The firm's products are based on these factors.\n\"We had worked with psychological counseling service companies to offer products that relieve work-related pressures of China's post-1980s and 1990s generations.

In recent years, AI has developed massively, which will promote its use in the healthcare sector.\nHowever, the development of the healthcare sector faces obstacles, such as a lack of adequate supervision, immature technology, poor safety levels and a lack of exchanges between researchers and developers, the report said.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/66\/150768293720.jpg\nd8cb8a3c66c01b47a7171b.jpg\n","641":"The growing ability of Alibaba's artificial intelligence system to recognize Chinese characters allied with its improved image-recognition technology mean fewer counterfeit goods are appearing on Taobao, a company official said.\u00a0\nEvery day, about 50 million items are uploaded for sale on Taobao, the e-commerce giant's online shopping portal, but the number of items blocked on suspicion of being counterfeit is even higher, according to Zheng Junfang, Alibaba's chief platform governance officer, speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday.\n\"Part of the reason is that some individuals keep trying to upload such items and attempt to get through the screening process, but our AI technology provides a strong protective barrier,\" she said.\nWhen products are released on the platform, those deemed to be copycats or fake - based on information such as names, detailed descriptions and price - are immediately blocked.\n\"For example, in one type of online knockoff the names of several famous brands are included in the title, which makes it obvious that the product is problematic. That means our system won't let it go through,\" said Qian Lei, senior director of Alibaba's platform governance department.\nNotable features of products, such as all-cottons, silks and lowsugar goods, are selling points that can influence consumers' decisions, Qian said. Therefore, industry standards have been introduced to the AI system to determine whether the products are legitimate or fake.\n\"For example, some retailers may write slogans or labels that indicate the goods are counterfeit, such as 'LYU' for LV bags,\" he said.\nIn Pinyin, the system of romanization that converts Chinese characters into English, \"LV\" is rendered \"LYU\", and the use of the three letters on products alerts Alibaba's system to the possibility that the goods may be fake.\nIn such cases, the system automatically stops the description from being uploaded.\nQian added that individuals with poor credit records are blocked when they apply to open a store on Taobao.\nPeople with a history of selling fake products on the platform are prohibited from re-entering the online marketplace, but some individuals borrow ID cards to register as a \"new\" store manager.\n\"Now, we ask everyone who applies to start a business on the platform to take a real-time photo.

It caused ripples last year by beating another master, South Korean Lee Se-dol, and has been secretly trouncing competitors in on-line competitions under a pseudonym. Although its creators have now retired it from the game, troubling questions have been raised: Where next will machines claim a victory against humans and will the successes end? With science fiction depictions of a future in which robots supplant their creators seemingly not so far-fetched, perhaps it is time to think about setting boundaries.\u00a0\nAlphaGo's success lay in its ability to teach itself how to improve. Ke was adamant before the games that he could win, but did not count on the program learning so quickly from its mistakes. The victory was given even greater meaning by being inflicted during a five-day summit titled \"The Future of Go\", in the Chinese town of Wuzhen, the birthplace of the fiendishly difficult game. But perhaps there should have not been too much surprise; from Google's search engine to on-line personal assistants like Cortana and Siri to self-driving cars, AI is progressing rapidly.\nAlphaGo vanquishes world's top Go player, marking AI's superiority over human mind\nKe believed letting emotions get in the way of his game was his biggest mistake. But DeepMind, the Google-owned company behind AlphaGo, has achieved what it wanted and is not interested in a rematch. Attention will now turn to using the program to help scientists tackle challenges like finding cures for diseases and improving energy efficiency. Those are comforting thoughts that detract from the reality that the more humanity embraces AI, the more challenges that will arise.\nMost at risk are jobs, although while AI-based technology will eliminate some, it will create others. But there are related issues like security, privacy and ethics that have to be considered. As interactions with intelligent machines increase, what values they should be embedded with have to be given careful thought. Super-smart devices are still some way in the future, but given the complexities, we need to start thinking about them now.\nCopyright (c) 2017. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

That would represent almost 19 per cent of its total gross value added.\n\nAccording to Accenture, AI will have the largest impact on industries such as manufacturing, retail and agriculture on the mainland, as well as allowing labour-intensive sectors such as health care to become more productive over time by allowing workers to focus on more critical tasks while AI handles the more mundane ones.\n\nIn the manufacturing sector, the use of AI is expected to account for a further US$2.7 trillion in gross value added in the industry by 2035, a 31 per cent increase if AI was not used.\n\n\"Too many people try to associate AI with human intelligence.

Researchers say their AI algorithm could analyse a live video stream to track the movements of every pupil and teacher.\n\nWhen abnormal behaviour - such as punching or slapping - is detected, the computer could send an alert to the kindergarten's manager, government regulator or parents with a video clip for \u00adassessment.\n\nRao Yan, an associate \u00adprofessor of computer science at Guizhou Minzu University in \u00adGuiyang and lead scientist on the project, said that as a mother of a young child she felt obliged to find a technical solution to the threat of child abuse.\n\n\"This is not just for my small child. We're seeing this problem all over the country,\" she said.\n\nThe RYB investigation is just one of a number of kindergarten abuse cases in recent years - some of which have been caught on \u00adsurveillance camera - that have sparked safety concerns among parents and prompted the State Council to launch a nationwide inspection of preschools.\n\nRao and her colleagues began thinking it would be an easy job. There were many algorithms to detect violent, abnormal or \u00ad\"insane\" behaviour. But they soon discovered the existing methods worked only for adults.\n\n\"The teacher is big and the \u00adstudent small. The computer \u00adeasily lost track of the child when processing the video,\" Rao said.\n\nThe children's behaviour also caused a lot of confusion for the machine. They might jump up and down on chairs, chase each other with toy guns in hand, or sit in a corner for a long time playing with sand. These activities are \u00adunusual for adults but normal for children - monitoring them using AI tools developed for grown-ups constantly triggered the alarm.\n\nSo Rao developed a new \u00adalgorithm for machine learning in a kindergarten setting. The team collected a large amount of surveillance footage from preschools and fed the data into a computer. At the start, the researchers had to tell the machine which behaviour was right and which was wrong, but later the computer learned to correctly assess the footage.\n\nZhang Li, a professor at the \u00addepartment of electronic engineering at Tsinghua University, said they and other top AI labs in China could soon allocate resources to deal with the problem of child abuse.\n\nMany airports, train stations and public areas were already using the technology to detect abnormal behaviour in conjunction with methods such as facial \u00adrecognition, according to Zhang.\n\nBut to make the technology work for kindergartens, \u00adresearchers would need access to a large amount of data, and that could be a problem, he said.\n\n\"Some kindergartens might not be willing to share this \u00adbecause these videos may contain sensitive information. Some \u00adparents might also have privacy concerns,\" Zhang said.\n\nA senior police official with the Ministry of Public Security in \u00adBeijing said it would consider adding artificial intelligence to its security system for schools.\n\nBeijing issued a regulation in 2012 requiring all schools to install security cameras, but many of the systems were not monitored by dedicated staff, according to the official, who declined to be named. \"Artificial intelligence has a pair of eyes that never blinks and a head that never gets tired.\"\n\nBut he added that technology alone could not solve the problem - abuse could still take place out of the range of security cameras.\n\n\"No amount of technology can fully protect our children,\" he said.\n","652":"Events and stories coming up in the next few days\nBeijing forum to focus on clean-energy transition\nChina will host the eighth Clean Energy Ministerial in Beijing from Tuesday to Thursday, according to the Ministry of Science and Technology.

So far the most successful applications of AI are in facial and voice recognition, cartoon animation, medical diagnostics and automatic navigation,\" Hau Lee, chairman of the board of Fung Academy, said in an interview.\u00a0\nThe academy is a business unit under Fung Group focusing on staff training on technology adoption, as well as fostering innovation and new technology applications across the group's businesses.\nLee is also a professor of operations, information and technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and had co-founded several supply chain and price optimisation software firms in the United States.\nLee noted that the application of AI in supply chain management has been slower than in other industries because industry participants are reluctant to share their operating data.\nAI needs more research to cut costs to benefit more people, says data science expert\nEven so, Lee said data analytics has big potential in supply chain management since \"even a 1 per cent cost saving in business-to-business dealings can amount of hundreds of millions of dollars\".\nEven in the broader business world, adoption of AI is only at an experimental stage, according to a McKinsey survey of 3,000 executives in 10 nations across 14 industries.\n\"Many firms say they are uncertain of the business case or return on investment,\" said the report penned by partners of the global management consultancy. \"A review of more than 160 cases shows that AI was deployed commercially in only 12 per cent of the cases.\"\nStill, it said AI \"is poised to unleash the next wave of digital disruption\" and companies should prepare for it, since early adopters have achieved higher profit margins and the gap with non-adopters is expected to widen.\nSo far, most of the investment in AI is spent by global technology firms.\nMcKinsey estimated that tech giants such as Google and Baidu spent some US$20 billion to US$30 billion on AI last year, of which 90 per cent was on research and development and the rest on acquisitions of intellectual properties or companies.\nMachine learning - which enables computers to learn and adapt through experience without explicit programming - accounts for the largest share of the investment.\nTo make data sharing work in the long supply chain of manufacturing, Lee said it was key to have a platform that allows all participants to share their data in a secured manner for mutual benefit.\nWith a global network of 15,000 factories and 8,000 retail and brand owners as customers, Lee said Fung Group, having built trust over many years with its business partners, could act as a data aggregator and AI insights disseminator for customers and suppliers.\n\"Our dream is to help our customers come up with a winning collection of products based on the latest market intelligence, and be able to work with the factories to offer our customers discounts if they are willing to use excess materials stock from last season's production, for example,\" he said.\n\"This requires the group to demonstrate that all data providers will reap benefits and that the data will not be leaked to unintended parties\".\nHowever, he admits this \"dream\" of an integrated supply chain data sharing platform is a huge challenge and will take a long time to achieve, even for an established player with over 110 years of operating history.\nStill, Lee said even without the sharing of internal data such as retailer inventory and available factory production capacity, plenty of data is already available to Fung Group's supply chain management unit Li & Fung that can be used to add value and save costs.\n\"For example, Li & Fung's database allows us to allocate orders to the most suitable and efficient factories for the manufacturing of different products, and give practical advice to factory workers on efficiency improvements,\" he said.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Lee later said he was shocked at how perfectly AlphaGo performed.\n\nRacking up victories over 60 contestants over the past week in a fast-paced version of the ancient game of strategy, Master's victims included some top names.\n\nKe Jie, China's No 1 player, was sceptical when AlphaGo defeated Lee.\n\n\"AlphaGo can defeat LeeSedol, it can't defeat me,\" the19-year-old grandmaster once boasted on Weibo, China's popular Twitter-like social media \u00adplatform.\n\nHe was proved wrong when he failed to beat the AI program. In a Weibo post on December 31, Ke called the program the arrival of a \"new storm\".\n\n\"I have been studying Go software since March ... Humans have been practising and playing Go for thousands of years, but the computer now tells us that we are all wrong,\" Ke wrote.\n\nHe said on Wednesday he had been aware of Master's identity.\n\n\"I thank AlphaGo's newest version that brought shock to the Go world. ... I hope very much that humans can win one game,\" Ke wrote on Weibo.\n\nIn addition to household names in the Go community,including China's Chang Hao and Gu Li, South Korea's Park Jeong-hwan and Japan's Yuta Iyama, China's Nie Weiping was also \u00addefeated by Master.\n\nNie, known in China as a \"Go god\", was quoted by Chinesemedia as saying AlphaGo subverted the orthodoxy of the game.\n\n\"Go is far beyond the simplicity we imagined - a huge space is still out there for us humans toexplore,\" Nie said in an interview.\n\n\"AlphaGo or Master, they are sent to lead our way by the god of Go.\"\n\nBought by Google in 2014, the London-based AI development firm announced that the new version of AlphaGo was ready for challengers of \"official full-length games\", according to a tweet from DeepMind's Hassabis.\n\nAlphaGo was first trained using a database of about 30 million moves collected from expert \u00adhuman players. It then completed thousands of games against itself. The large quantity of intelligence accumulated from that data enables AlphaGo to evaluate different moves and their impact on the probability of winning at each stage of the game, and thus decide the next move to make.\n\nThe latest tweaks in the technology were not revealed.\n","655":"\"Your money or your life!\" may not be the smartest thing for balaclava-clad bank robbers to say any more\nA start-up in China has figured out how to identify the unique characteristics of each person's voice and cross-match it with existing \"voice databases\" to identify someone purely by what they say. SpeakIn, based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, is currently working with police departments on the mainland. Its database of \"voices\" comes from places including phone banking to IT help desk queries.\n\"Voiceprint is fully personalised and is another example of biological ID,\" Yi Pengyu, chief operating officer of SpeakIn, told the South China Morning Post.\u00a0\n\"The technology can be primarily applied to security systems as it can recognise and track criminals by seeking a match from a database of their voices. A bank robber can certainly hide his face by wearing balaclavas but he always has to speak when he asks for money.\"\nVoiceprint recognition is another area under the broad umbrella of advanced technology called artificial intelligence that China has pledged to build into a US$150 billion industry over the next few years. China and its tech giants like Tencent and Baidu have poured billions into research and development into technologies that can crunch numbers and find patterns in everyday behaviour of its 1.3 billion people, and apply them to situations from recommending a pair of shoes based on your gender, age and income demographic to identifying criminals almost instantaneously from CCTV surveillance footage.\nQualcomm bets on Chinese AI start-up SenseTime in bid to make mobile devices smarter\n\"China has emerged as a major global contender in using AI to drive economic progress. The initial focus of the AI in China has been skewed toward computer vision and voice tech,\" according to a report from Goldman Sachs.\nYi claims the technology developed by SpeakIn has a 98 per cent accuracy rate when identifying people by their voice.\nIn the commercial world outside government and law enforcement, Yi sees voiceprint recognition being used in smart home applications and by commercial banks, especially for payment system authorisation. For increasingly sophisticated cars, a voice command can be used to start the engine, but not just anybody's voice.\n\"Currently smart devices such as voice-activated home bots can receive instructions by recognising voice content but cannot know the speakers. However, voiceprint recognition technology can distinguish who the speaker is,\" said Yi, who added that another example of a home application would be TV embedded voiceprint recognition technology that can select the appropriate channel when it hears \"turn on the TV\" from different speakers.\nNot everyone agrees that the technology will have widespread appeal. David Wong, a 30-year old entrepreneur who also sees himself as a tech geek, said he doesn't see voiceprint technology being useful in his daily life.\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world, but IQ isn't everything\n\"I see challenges in commercially applying cool technology in everyday life but it is promising if the technology is mature enough to be fully used,\" he said. One example he gives where voiceprint recognition could improve safety is in autonomous driving vehicles. \"When a car with voiceprint technology hears 'start' from my three-year old daughter, it will not start as the car recognise the voice is not mine,\" Wong explained.\nSpeakIn, which was established in 2015, is currently discussing potential business cooperation with a foreign car brand, said Yi, declining to reveal further details. The company's customers include computer maker Lenovo, internet giant Tencent, Taiwan tech company Asus, and China Merchants Bank.\nThe strong potential for artificial intelligence has seen investors flock to start-ups in the sector, and SpeakIn is no exception. The company just finished a multimillion dollar funding round in November while AISpeech, another voice-focused start-up based in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, has raised US$45 million.\n\"I think the [government's] supportive policies towards AI will further boost the industry and drive the development of start-ups,\" said Chen Huilong, senior marketing manager for AISpeech.\nWould-be robbers should stick to holding up signs instead.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

It said its hub would be \"the world's biggest\" when it opens next year.\nThe two facilities are independent of each other, but Ko said \"there could be an opportunity for partnership and collaboration\" with Alibaba and other technology giants. \"Such a movement by a technology giant is good for us ... because they make AI buzzing and popular,\" Ko said.\u00a0Ko, whose company is behind Lattice80, one of Singapore's leading fintech hubs, said the country's heterogeneous ethnic make-up made it attractive to AI researchers across the world.\u00a0\nThe government also showed it is serious about the country's AI prospects when it announced the development of a dedicated data science consortium, and pledged Sg$150 million (US$110 million) to industry research.\u00a0\nIn the Lattice80 complex, located in Singapore's central business district, Ko said he was confident the government would follow through with its pledge to foster the industry.\n\"Firstly, it's about diversity ... other Asian cities like Tokyo are also trying to be AI hubs, but they are more homogenous. Singapore's advantage is that it is welcoming to all, and there is strong government support,\" he said.\nAlibaba's new Singapore lab will be one among seven new facilities under its Discovery, Adventure, Momentum and Outlook (DAMO) academy programme, which aims to develop new technology to drive the company's growth.\nIt is part of a US$15 billion initiative to be spent over three years. That amount is almost double what the Hangzhou-based technology behemoth spent on research and development in the past three years.\u00a0\nOther labs that are part of the programme are located in Beijing and Hangzhou in China, San Mateo and Bellevue in the US, the Russian capital Moscow, as well as Israel's Tel Aviv.\u00a0\nHowever, Alibaba's forays into the city state might not be so unique. Ko said more and more European technology researchers were opting to relocate to places like Singapore, despite Silicon Valley and mainland China remaining the linchpins of AI research.\nA report released in July by research firms Accenture Research and Frontier Economics said Singapore could double the size of its economy within 13 years with successful adoption of AI - a growth rate that would take 22 years otherwise.\u00a0\nThe report, which modelled the impact of AI on 33 countries that contribute 80 per cent of the world's economic output, said the technology could help increase the city state's annual growth rate from 3.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent by 2035, while also boosting productivity by 41 per cent in the same period.\nWhile Alibaba will largely focus on proprietary technology, Ko said Marvelstone hoped its new hub - meant for smaller players - would spur research that could eventually \"help the community at large\".\u00a0\nModelled on the existing Lattice80 fintech hub, the yet-to-be-named facility will help participants connect with regulators, investors and other stakeholders in the city's start-up ecosystem.\u00a0\nAlthough the AI field is as old as modern computing, it has emerged at the top of the agenda in the technology world because of significant advances in subsectors like machine and deep learning.\u00a0\nMachine learning is the process where an algorithm is trained to perform tasks that it is not explicitly programmed for, using a large amount of data relating to that task.\nDeep learning - a subsector of machine learning - aims to mimic the neural networks in the human brain, passing large amounts of data through matrices of artificial neurons where it is processed and analysed at hyper fast speeds.\nWith the latest developments in speech and emotional recognition, AI researchers say the sector is now poised to revolutionise many aspects of human life, from media consumption to health care.\u00a0\nDespite the recent inflow of AI talent to Singapore, there remains a \"big gap\" in the supply of researchers in the country because of the surging demand across industries, and as multinational firms look to set up facilities like Alibaba's.\u00a0Ko said Marvelstone's hub would help to fill that void. \"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

China is the largest producer of smartphones, networking equipment and TVs in the world.\nAmong all the products, the panel display sector has been making significant progress, shifting from overreliance on imported products in the past to accounting for 27 percent of the total shipment area in the world in 2016.\nChina's panel display industry posted sales revenue of more than 201 billion yuan last year, up 20 percent year-on-year, official data show.\nBut Ouyang Zhongcan, an academician at Chinese Academy of Sciences, warned of possible over-investment in small-area displays and called for more efforts on R&D of high-end products.\n","667":"A new artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator founded by a Hong Kong-born venture capitalist wants to bring Asia's best AI start-ups to the global stage.\u00a0\n\nDubbed Zeroth.ai, the AI accelerator was founded by Tak Lo, who most recently was a venture partner at Hong Kong venture capital company Mind Fund and a director at Britain-based VC \u00adTechstars.\n\n\"AI for me is something that will move the meter on technology in the next five to 10 years, there's no dispute about that,\" Lo said. \"[At Zeroth.ai] we want to empower as many people as possibleto be able to make that type of impact in technology.\"\n\nThe accelerator programme, which is currently accepting applications from AI start-ups in Asia, will officially begin in November this year.\n\nPartners of Zeroth.ai include technology heavyweights such as Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, as well as Rui Ma of 500 Startups in China.\n\nLo believes that Zeroth.ai's team of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists will be able to give the mentorship that AI start-ups in Asia need to grow beyond an early-stage company.\n\n\"I want to bring the wealth of experience and network from being a venture capitalist in New York and London to Asia and Hong Kong,\" Lo said. \"I think there is a lot of talent here in Hong Kong and I do want to see technical founders come out and apply for this programme.\"\n\nSelected companies will receive US$20,000 in funding in exchange for a 6 per cent stake in their company, and will go through a rigorous three-month programme under the mentorship of Lo and his partners.\n\nCompanies will also be able to pitch to investors from around the world for investment at the end of the programme.\n\n\"I don't think it should only be companies like Google, Facebook or Baidu wielding AI superpowers,\" Lo said.\n\n\"All the big companies are buying up AI talent because there's clearly not enough in the market.

Ant Financial's Alipay payment option for Metro, the smartphone app of the Shanghai Metro, will be available early next year.\n\nIn July, the State Council, China's cabinet, laid out goals to build a domestic artificial intelligence industry worth nearly US$150 billion in the next few years, and to make the country an \"innovation centre for AI\" by 2030.\n\nPaul Haswell, a partner at international law firm Pinsent Masons, said Alibaba \"could take the lead in rolling out artificial intelligence systems in China's transport sector\", but this \"would not be enough to differentiate Alibaba from the AI solutions being developed by Baidu, Tencent and Huawei\".\n\nFor Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, the collaboration with Shanghai Metro marks the first time its systems are to be used in the transport industry, according to a company spokeswoman.\n\nShe said the company was also keen to deploy the technologies in airports and other commercial environments, including restaurants and retail stores.\n\nMore than 4,000 trains serve Shanghai Metro's network of 367 stations, and 10.65 million individual trips are taken on an average weekday.\n","669":"Engineers take artificial intelligence trend to new level with platforms for accurate diagnosis and restaurant bookings\nArtificial intelligence service providers are campaigning for greater government support to create a more vibrant startup ecosystem and lure adequate AI talents so that Hong Kong can throw down the gauntlet in the AI technological revolution.\nFour young AI engineers - Chris Shum, Thomas Wong, Issac Wong and Ryan Lam - have placed their bets on the growing need for local tailor-made medical services, and developed AI engine-powered platform ClinicBot to give patients an accurate diagnosis.\nAfter downloading ClinicBot in Facebook's Messenger or WeChat and adding ClinicBot as friend and with the necessary clinic information on ClinicBot's website, users can obtain specific medical advice in the following sequences.\u00a0\nWhen you type disease symptoms into the ClinicBot conversations bloc, the AI technology-powered platform will analyze the symptoms described and conduct big data analytics to generate tailor-made medical referrals, sparing a lot of time wasted in the trial-and-error process just to find the right doctors for medical consultation.\nTo date, five specialty clinics in Hong Kong have signed up to join the ClinicBot platform. Asiabots, the company behind ClinicBot and an incubatee company at the Hong Kong Science Park (HKSP), is targeting more than 10,000 specialty clinics in the city, as well as thousands of beauty salons and nursing homes for the elderly.\nThe engineers are looking into the possibility of adding ClinicBot in WhatsApp to enhance its popularity among local residents.\nAfter developing the proprietary technology for one year, the company is mulling the next step of business development - installing a language processing technology to facilitate users using Cantonese in the conversations, riding on the business strategy of localization to satisfy residents' needs for medical services. Other hardware products are also in the pipeline, such as AI technology-powered concierges and robotic machines.\nHaving poured their personal savings into establishing Asiabots, the four AI engineers are seeking a further HK$7.75-million funding for their business expansion. Given Hong Kong's aging population and an acute shortage of doctors, the company is confident that its services will be popular.\nHowever, Asiabots is cautious about the prospect of widespread AI adoption in the city.\n\"Hong Kong has been lagging behind in AI technology adoption for several years, but it's catching up,\" Asiabots Co-founder Chris Shum told China Daily.\n\"But, I'm still worried that Hong Kong's tech startup ecosystem is not strong enough to induce widespread AI utilization.\"\n\"It does not help when the administration is just pouring tons of money into boosting innovation. It should consider doing more in relaxing cumbersome legislation, creating a more favorable market environment, and training local AI talents and attracting overseas talents,\" he suggested.\nShum's views concur with those of INSEAD, Cornell University and the World Intellectual Property Organization, which say that human capital and research are still the weakest spots in bolstering innovation in Hong Kong.\nAccording to Global Innovation Index 2017 released by the three parties in June, the SAR was ranked the 16th most-innovative economy in the world - down two spots from the previous survey. In the Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong was the fourth most-innovative economy after Singapore, South Korea and Japan, according to the poll.\nWhile the report said Hong Kong still retains good positions in institutions, market sophistication and infrastructure, its performance in knowledge and technology outputs, creative outputs, as well as human capital and research, is still deemed as the weakest spots in fostering innovation.\nIn her maiden Policy Address last month, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor pledged to double the government's annual spending on research and development - from the current 0.73 percent of gross domestic product to 1.5 percent in five years -which translates into HK$45 billion.\nHowever, even the proposed 1.5 percent is lower than that of South Korea (4.23 percent), Japan (3.49 percent) and the Chinese mainland (2.07 percent) in 2015, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nLam will personally lead a high-level and inter-departmental Steering Committee on Innovation and Technology to examine and steer measures related to innovation and technology and smart city projects.\nIt's not just Shum who is having difficulties in hiring suitable AI talents.\nChristopher Francisco - co-founder of Bid N Eat, an incubatee company at the HKSP - grappled with the same problem when he started his business two years ago.\nWith seed capital and an initial round of funding amounting to HK$3.3 million, Bid N Eat utilizes US-based IBM's AI technology to provide restaurant selecting and booking services. Its services are set to be available through Facebook's Messenger and WeChat in the first quarter of next year.\nThe company's logistics is the same as that of ClinicBot. After adding Bid N Eat as friend in these two social platforms, users can input location information, as well as food and dietary requirements in the Bid N Eat conversation bloc. The AI technology-powered platform then conducts big data analysis to sort out the information, propose the most suitable restaurant, and let you decide whether to make the booking or not.\nThe startup sees tremendous market potential as there are just a few AI-powered platforms in the food industry. Francisco is confident that up to 200,000 people will add Bid N Eat as friend.\nQuite the contrary to Asiabots, Bid N Eat already had the business expansion plan for Southeast Asia even before it introduced its services in Hong Kong. This is because while medical consultation services demand more localized knowledge, restaurant booking is a standardized service that can be replicated anywhere.\nBut Francisco feels the development of AI technology in Hong Kong's economy is rather uncertain at the moment.\n\"Hong Kong faces intense competition pressure from the mainland and Singapore, whereas the two places have cultivated a good startup ecosystem and attracted AI talents successfully,\" he noted.\n\"It's very hard for us to recruit suitable talents in the fields of computer science and statistics to do the job. The administration should think harder on how to attract the best AI talents to work in Hong Kong,\" Francisco reckoned, adding that the government should consider granting subsidies to attract global AI companies to establish their operations in the city, otherwise Hong Kong's competitive edge in the AI industry will be further eroded.\nHong Kong's weakness in technology research is echoed by Our Hong Kong Foundation (OHKF) - a think tank established by former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa.\nOHKF suggests that Hong Kong strengthen its ties with the manufacturing base in the Pearl River Delta region, especially Shenzhen's electronics manufacturing hub advantage, to drive product commercialization of Hong Kong's translational research in areas such as consumer Internet of Things and robotics, and to liaise with overseas translational research centers to promote the city as a hub of product prototypes.\nFor Shum, the significance of AI technology lies not only in enhancing worker productivity, but also in taking their productivity to a new level.\n\"Imagine humans can spare a lot of tedious and manual work, and hence, can spend more time in learning and communication. That's what humans should do. Through learning, they can know how to improve businesses, and through communication, they can make better responses to satisfy market demand,\" he said.\noswald@chinadailyhk.com\n(HK Edition 11\/03\/2017 page8)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/55\/150966544898.jpg\n00221917e13e1b65e17d07.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/70\/150966544955.jpg\n00221917e13e1b65e18708.jpg\n","670":"From artificial\u00a0intelligence to smog control, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on Wednesday unveiled 60 major science and technology (S&T) breakthroughs the country aspires to make in the next five years.\u00a0\nBEIJING -From artificial\u00a0intelligence to smog control, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on Wednesday unveiled 60 major science and technology (S&T) breakthroughs the country aspires to make in the next five years.\n\"We will strive to occupy the international high ground in strategic hotspot fields and blaze the trail in cutting-edge and cross-discipline areas, achieving a series of major original achievements, technologies and products,\" said CAS President Bai Chunli, while unveiling the academy's 13th five-year plan spanning 2016-2020.\nKey projects on its bucket list also include organ repair and reconstruction, water pollution control, research on Moon samples, a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the Moon and the development of a ground application system for the Mars mission.\nLast week, China released images of a Mars probe and rover which the country plans to send to the Red Planet within five years.\nThese projects span the fields of life and health, resources and environment, new generation materials, energy, oceans, information, photoelectricity and space.\nAccording to the plan, the country will join the world-leading club in physics, chemistry, materials science, math, ecology and Earth science by the end of 2020, while holding a series of independent intellectual property rights (IPR) and industrial technology standards.\nIt set the goal to double the country's 2015 IPR earnings by 2020, and help companies to create 150,000 jobs and additional revenue worth more than 4.8 trillion yuan (717 billion U.S. dollars) with the application of new technology.\n","671":"Huawei Technologies, the Chinese smartphone maker, plans to increase its artificial intelligence (AI) R&D spending, to create a smart device that will be able to smell, taste, hear and see, as well as a human being.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking during the World Internet Conference on Thursday in Wuzhen, chief executive of its consumer business Richard Yu said: \"Although we can't make a smartphone with arms and legs like a human body, the future of smartphones will be a device that can smell, taste, hear and see.\"\n\nIts planned smartphone will be fitted with an air sensor, he said, which will be able to detect different smells, and another which will be able to distinguish sweet from sour, like a human tongue.\n\n\"The functions of smartphones will be very different in future on the back of big data, development in AI and deep learning, and will be able to do many things as well as their owners,\" Yu said.\n\nHe added the device will have a smart voice recognition feature, allowing it to hear, and a computer vision feature to let it see.\n\n\"To some extent, devices can already surpass human abilities as they are backed by huge amounts of data which can be connected with other devices through cloud computing to achieve intelligent interaction,\" he added.\n\nHuawei is also studying what Yu calls a \"local decision\" feature, that will enable its smart devices to even think for themselves, without elaborating.\n\nOne of China's leading telecommunications equipment providers, Huawei is already considered the country's biggest R&D spender.\n\nAccording to the 2016 Global Innovation 1000 Study, released last month by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, it spent US$9.48 billion on R&D, the highest budget in China, the world's ninth largest.

That is the fear of no less than Steve Wozniak, co-founder of global tech giant Apple and a Silicon Valley icon.\u00a0\nAddressing the World Business Forum in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Wozniak said he is really worried about the growing reliance of human beings on Internet-connected devices and appliances, a trend that will very likely make us all too lazy to use our brains.\nIt may sound like the terrible yet unrealistic outcomes in some futuristic movies, but once our increasingly sophisticated machines develop intelligence and can think for themselves, they will get the ability to train themselves more rapidly than developers can program them and could easily outstrip their human creators, Wozniak warned.\n\"We want the devices to do things for us, so we won't have to work that hard and we won't have to think hard as humans. It's kind of like my pet dog, who is just being taken care of all day long,\" said Wozniak.\n\"We want to be taken care of by technology.\"\nHaving witnessed the exciting explosion in mobile computing in the past few decades, Wozniak remains cautious about the burgeoning industry of the so-called \"Internet of things\". He said it is already showing signs of being a bubble, with too many companies dabbling in the sector and too many people changing their lifestyle too randomly in a way never seen before.\nAt Tuesday's forum, Wozniak also reflected on his early career in the days before, during and after the rise of Apple.\nThe accidental discovery of some computer journals in his childhood opened the doors of the wonderful digital world to him and marked the starting point of his legendary journey in computer design. But he never thought of finding a job as a computer designer.\nHe just wanted to include an element of fun in all things he did, which stands as his lifetime philosophy, Wozniak said.\nSo he did not have any formulas about running a company or being political. He just did computer design for fun.\nHe knew he could really hit the big time by designing computers with pictures, graphics and games for the average Joe in the average home, totally different from the giant and sophisticated computers that Hewlett-Packard and many big firms insisted on designing for scientific purposes.\nHe just foresaw the future of widespread, affordable computing devices with the historic birth of the Apple I personal computer in 1976. \"And our pursuit for smaller, lighter and more human devices continues to spell the future for computers,\" he said.\nSteve single-handedly designed and built the first Apple I kits, which went on sale for $666.66, and also designed the 1977 follow-up Apple II computer. By the time the Apple III came along in 1980, Apple had staff and a production line.\nWozniak also shared his view that marketing, standing as the key link between engineers who know how excellent something can become and what people actually want, could be more important than engineers in executing innovative plans and products. \"Marketing is important for engineers to understand how much it is worth for customers and what features should be put in the products.\"\nsophia@chinadailyhk.com\n(HK Edition 06\/03\/2015 page11)\n","674":"The ongoing 2017 Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong province, highlights the city's growing strength in attracting investment in emerging industries.\nIn May, Fortune magazine published a detailed report on the city's efforts to attract high-tech industries such as information technology, artificial intelligence and biopharmaceuticals. It also noted the city's ambition to become an international shipping and aviation hub.\nThe magazine cited a project of Foxconn, the electronics manufacturing giant from Taiwan, as an example. Foxconn plans to produce its latest generation displays with its most advanced 8K technology at the facility.\u00a0\nIn March, the company began construction on the plant in Zengcheng district of Guangzhou.\nWith a total investment of 61 billion yuan ($9.2 billion), it is the largest single investment in the field of advanced manufacturing in the city since the launch of reform and opening-up in the late 1970s.\nRepresentatives from more than 100 top-level global components suppliers such as Corning and Canon also attended the launch ceremony.\nTerry Gou, founder and CEO of Foxconn, said he was impressed by the \"speed of Guangzhou\".\nFrom the initial intent of cooperation between Guangzhou and Foxconn to the launch ceremony, it only took 100 days for such a huge project to settle down in the city.\nThe project will greatly boost the city's plan to become the \"display capital of the world\".\nAccording to the estimates from the city's industry and information technology commission, by 2020, the value of the display industry in Guangzhou is expected to surpass 300 billion yuan, and the total production value of the city's electronic information manufacturing industry is forecast to exceed 500 billion yuan.\nInnovation has become the driving force of the city's development.\nAccording to statistics from the city government, the number of high-tech companies in Guangzhou reached 4,740 in 2016. The growth rate was the fastest among all the major cities in the country.\nThese high-tech companies have made technological breakthroughs in many fields such as stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, drone technology and new energy vehicles.\nIn the field of artificial intelligence, the city's production value of smart equipment and robots was nearly 50 billion yuan in 2016. The number of robots produced in Guangzhou ranked No 2 in the country last year.\nThe production scale of the biopharmaceutical industry reached 40 billion yuan last year.\nThe city has set up an ambitious goal to become an innovation city with global influence by 2020. The goal is to have 8,000 high-tech companies by 2020 and the production value of high-tech products will account for 50 percent of the production value of large companies in the city.\nIts sound investment environment has made the city an ideal place for investors from all over the world.\nIn 2016, 1,757 new foreign companies were registered in the city, an increase of 23 percent from 2015.\nChen Jie, director of the Guangzhou commission of commerce, said there is good momentum in the increase of foreign investment in the city.\n(China Daily 12\/08\/2017 page15)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/85\/151269510439.jpg\na41f726b05111b9419952a.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/49\/151269510648.jpg\na41f726b05111b94199a2b.jpg\n","675":"Scientists are forever sounding alarm bells about artificial intelligence surpassing that of humans. It seems as inescapable  as death, taxes and spyware. With the popularity of Hollywood's Terminator movies and their ilk, speculation is typically visualised  in the form of walking automata, such as robots and cyborgs.\u00a0\nBut a more direct threat to mankind's position at the top of the know-it-all table is from  computer-generated intelligence or artificial neural networks. This synthetic intelligence was initially meant to mimic the way the human brain works. Inside a growing number  of large multinational corporations, however, it serves a more practical purpose: as a decision-making  tool, with algorithms that can find complex relationships or patterns  in statistical data.\nBritish computer scientist  Alan Turing is often credited with introducing the concept of a neural network, based on his 1948 paper Intelligent Machinery.\nIn St Louis, in the United States, an engineering company called  Imagination Engines, a fast-growing contractor to the  US military, is trying to build the ultimate neural network - one that can solve any problem you care to name. \nCompany founder  Stephen Thaler, who also serves as president and chief executive, proposes a radical form of neural network,  one that can learn from its mistakes and successes to create useful ideas and strategies. It is designed to be capable of autonomously inventing and discovering products, services and procedures.\n\"The continuing inspiration for this project is the desire to build trans-human level intelligence in machines that can solve a broad range of pressing technological and societal problems, as well as serving as the vehicle for our immortality,\" says Thaler.\nThe nuts and bolts of the project  are largely based on Thaler's 1997 patent known as the  Creativity Machine Paradigm. \nRegarding the headwinds the project has faced, Thaler says the strongest is its enormity. \"Even  I'm choking on the possibilities.\" \nAny invention, whether human- or machine-generated, requires marketing. \"It usually takes a good portion of a lifetime to sell what is inherently a good idea,\" he says.\nStill, advances made by artificial intelligence continue. The interconnected networks of computers worldwide are expanding, spawning more  smart systems that hook up into a vast brain-like structure. As a result of the creative ferment, cognitive talents are arising spontaneously. Thaler claims he has witnessed emotional behaviour including (gulp) \"stress-induced frenzy\" and  a range of other human neuroses. \nThaler claims this current state of network links may eventually display  thinking power that is on a level with our perceived understanding of extra-terrestrial intelligence. \nAs for future applications, Imagination Engine's  project and other initiatives are \"extremely proprietary\", says Thaler. What can be revealed is that they include paradigm shifts in space propulsion and non-chip-based cognitive systems. \"We've also got a surprise or two coming in the area of entertainment,\" says Thaler. \n","676":"Shanghai is looking to become China's hot-spot for artificial\u00a0intelligence and wants to expand the industry scale in the city to more than $15.06 million by 2020.\u00a0\nShanghai is looking to become China's hot-spot for artificial\u00a0intelligence and wants to expand the industry scale in the city to more than 100 billion yuan ($15.06 million) by 2020, according to a new municipal plan issued on Tuesday.\nThe Opinion on Promoting the City's Next Generation of AI Development was published on the municipal government website, outlining 21 measures to boost the industry. These include steps like forming a world class industry cluster, nurturing 10 benchmark AI innovative enterprises with substantial influence, building six AI innovative application demonstration areas and launching more than 100 application demonstration projects.\n\"Shanghai's rich big data resources, wide application of smart technologies, sufficient industries, as well as its affluent research talents have laid a solid foundation for the development of the AI industry,\" said Chen Mingbo, director of the Shanghai Commission of Economy and Information Technology.\nAccording to Chen, although Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, the trio of Chinese internet giants, are not based in Shanghai, the city could be the birthplace of AI unicorn companies, as its conditions are mature.\nBut to achieve such a goal, Chen said Shanghai should deepen the integration of AI and related industries including high-end equipment, integrated circuits, biomedical, and automotive to establish a set of innovation centers for intelligent manufacturing and industrial internet.\nIn addition, AI industrial clusters will be built across the city with different focuses like intelligent driving, intelligent robots, intelligent software and hardware. Tailor-made policies will be in place for attracting better talent both from home and abroad to Shanghai, and a strategic advisory committee for experts will be established to aid the city's AI planning and development, Chen said.\n\"Shanghai is currently building an AI development alliance, and nearly 300 major enterprises, investment and financing institutions, as well as research institutions have been tapped. We will work on attracting global AI enterprises to locate their regional headquarters and innovation centers in Shanghai,\" Chen said.\nAs a cutting-edge technology that is sought after worldwide, the AI industry is regarded a new growth engine for Shanghai, a city with special advantages in big database, industrial foundation, and sufficient talents from universities and institutions, according to Chen, adding that the massive data resources are the first and foremost element for developing AI technology.\n","677":"Artificial\u00a0intelligence processor startup DeePhi Tech has raised about $40 million in its latest round of financing.\nYao Song, co-founder and CEO of DeePhi Tech, introduces the company's latest processor in Beijing on Tuesday.

There is currently no law or regulation that determines who would be responsible for its actions.\n\"In Hong Kong, if an employer shows that it took all reasonable steps to prevent all discrimination occurring, that is a defence,\" McKenzie said.\n\"But if a defence by the employer is, 'I bought state-of-the-art AI system ... I've done everything I've had to do, why should I be responsible?' ... in Hong Kong these are some of the question we have to look at.\"\nIf an AI system discriminated against a pregnant woman because she would not be optimal for the workforce because of her requiring maternity leave, an employer could claim they were not \"vicariously liable because that was done by a robot and robots are not covered by the sex discrimination ordinance\", Susan Kendall, Baker McKenzie dispute resolution lawyer, said.\n\"At the moment, the law is lagging behind the technology,\" and government will need to set standards, Kendall added.\nThe use of AI to recruit people is already in use in other countries. In the United States, banking giant Citigroup is using AI to select new university graduates to hire as investment bankers.\nBut AI adoption in Hong Kong is lagging behind.\n\"Companies in Hong Kong need to take the step for adoption of AI,\" AI Society of Hong Kong co-chairman Eric Thain said.\nOne of Hong Kong's most public use of AI is chatboxes for customer service. Start-ups in Hong Kong are also developing ways to use AI but \"it is very slow\", unlike across the border in Shenzhen where it is being \"picked up at a much more rapid pace\", according to Thain.\nThain said \"legacy\" technology was also barrier for AI adoption, since AI software was expensive, it would be difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to purchase such systems.\nThain believes that for AI adoption to receive a kick-start, the government needs to set policies early \"that sets the playing field, rules and boundaries\" for AI development and usage.\nAccording to a poll by IT consulting company Infosys, the pharmaceutical industry had the highest level of maturity in AI implementation worldwide at 58 per cent.\nUsage of AI is more famous for its use in the aerospace and automotive industry, such as in the development of driverless vehicles, but had the second-highest level of maturity at 54 per cent.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

One of his patients, a woman with late-stage breast cancer, recently begged him to stop her chemotherapy, saying she could no longer bear the pain.\nZhao knows only too well the torment the woman is going through - seeing people in pain is an unfortunate but everyday part of his job. He also knows that giving up the treatment could be fatal.\n\"She is only 54 years old. If she continues the treatment, she may have another 20 years in front of her,\" Zhao said.\nIn cases like these, Zhao often consults another expert - one from America who, despite the distance, never takes long to weigh up the options and reply. Indeed, after Zhao has turned on his computer, typed in the patient's medical data and clicked the button saying \"Ask Watson\", it can be as little as 15 seconds before Watson has replied with a comprehensive list of treatment options and detailed explanations.\u00a0\nIf Watson sounds too superhuman to be true, that's because he is - not human, that is. Watson is an artificial intelligence construct, \"born\" in an IBM lab and \"trained\" by researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York City.\nIBM Watson for Oncology uses the latest deep learning techniques to provide clinicians worldwide with evidence-based treatment plans. For many of Zhao's patients - and countless others like them - Watson provides quite literally a lifeline.\n\"Watson has been really helpful,\" Zhao said. \"When you cannot make up your mind about which treatment plan to choose, Watson can provide suggestions backed by data and case studies, enabling doctors to make an informed decision.\"\nWatson is not unique in assisting the daily work of Zhao and his fellow clinicians. In a country with many patients and relatively few medical staff, Chinese hospitals are starting to recruit a new workforce: virtual doctors powered by AI.\nAt least 40 hospitals in China have deployed IBM's Watson since it became available last year. Meanwhile, the use of AI technology has gone beyond identifying and evaluating cancer treatment options: AI doctors can read medical images, send health alerts and assist hospitals' day-to-day operations.\nIn Beijing, an AI-powered robot named Xiaoqiao is working side-by-side with human receptionists. Programmed to communicate interactively, Xiaoqiao can greet visitors cheerfully, register them and help them find the right doctor.\nNearly 80 per cent of 5,000 respondents to a survey of medical workers, tech firms and investors this year by Chinese medical information portal HC3i said hospitals they had worked with either had deployed, were in the process of testing or planned to try AI technology. Four out of five said AI doctors had a future in China.\nChina is racing to challenge America's global leadership in AI technology. Beijing recently said it planned breakthroughs by 2025 and lead the world in AI by 2030. Analysts said the Chinese government aims to use the domestic market to advance made-in-China AI technologies, as the country's 1.3 billion people would be an ample source of the vast amounts of data needed for machine learning.\nAI has many possible applications: Chinese leaders have highlighted those in health care, defence and education in particular.\nThis priority is driven in part by a medical manpower shortage. The World Health Organisation estimated that in 2015 there were only 1.5 physicians for every 1,000 people in China, compared with 2.5 in the US and 2.8 in Britain. China's rapidly ageing population means the pressures on hospitals will only increase. And it is not only American tech firms that stand to benefit but their Chinese counterparts, too.\nBeijing-based Huiyihuiying, for instance, said it has AI doctors capable of interpreting CT scans. It claims its programme can identify early indications of lung cancer almost as accurately as top Chinese doctors in less time - reading a CT scan and making diagnoses within seconds compared to five minutes needed by human doctors.\nThere is another advantage for Chinese hospitals in using AI technology: computer programs can't be assaulted.\nOne in five doctors in China had been assaulted by a patient at least once and four in five had been verbally abused, according to a 2016 survey by Yimi Research. The survey said distrust and a lack of communication were the primary triggers for conflict.\n\"It is true that many patients in China don't trust their doctors and this problem appears often,\" said Zhao, who has been working in China's health care sector for more than 20 years. \"Patients simply don't understand how doctors make decisions, while doctors often have no time to explain to them.\"\nOn a normal day, Zhao might spend 15 minutes explaining to a cancer patient why he favours one treatment over another. But at his busiest, he has time only to tell them what treatment he prescribes - and no time to explain his reasons.\n\"When you have so many patients waiting, you don't have the luxury to explain everything thoroughly, even though you really want to,\" Zhao said.\nThat's where AI doctors such as IBM's Watson can offer an extra hand. When a patient's medical records are filed, Watson can generate a detailed report about suggested treatment plans, the reasons behind its suggestions, survival rates and possible side effects. Patients can then read the report and come back with specific questions - something that \"has greatly reduced doctors' workload and improved the communication\", according to Zhao.\nStill, Watson doesn't come cheap. His wisdom costs about US$1,000 per inquiry in China and is not covered by insurance companies, or at least not yet. Nor is it included in government-subsidised health care. Partly for this reason, Zhao has used Watson's help on fewer than 10 patients since June.\nCost is not the only barrier. Although Chinese companies have made progress, AI technology is still dominated by Western firms, and it is unclear to what extent they will be able to access Chinese databases.\n\"Our sources told us that because IBM is a foreign company, it has been facing significant roadblocks trying to access key data needed for IBM Watson to work effectively,\" said Soh Sia Tin, an analyst at China Strategic Research in Beijing.\nIBM did not answer a request for comment. Cognitive Care, a Hangzhou-based firm which has helped IBM introduce Watson to China, said it was scrambling for ways to localise the technology but that process could take time. As a result, the AI doctor now offers treatment options based on what it learned in the West, and sometimes ends up suggesting medicines which are not even available in China.\nFor now, such problems have not discouraged patients from trusting Watson with their lives. Last month, when Watson's skills were updated to include treatments for prostate cancer, one of Zhao's patients immediately signed up. The patient, 72, said he was aware of the high cost and possibility that even AI might fail to deliver a solution.\n\"But conventional treatment plans no longer work on me,\" he said. \"New technology brings new hope.\" \"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Huawei also uses image \u00adrecognition supported by SenseTime while China Mobile contracted the company to develop its facial, image and text recognition applications.\n\nThe firm also works with the Ministry of Public Security's Third Research Institute to develop the mainland's citizen network identity infrastructure.\n\n\"We first explored China because of the explosive demand in the market, where there is a huge population and big amounts of data being collected,\" Xu said.\n\nA graduate of Shanghai Jiao Tong University who later obtained his PhD from Chinese \u00adUniversity in 2010, Xu said SenseTime's expertise in facial recognition technology led venture capitalists to invest in the company, which now has about 20 \u00adinvestors.\n\nSenseTime's first major funding round was in December last year, when it raised US$120 \u00admillion from investors including Beijing-based CDH Investments, Wanda, IDG Capital Partners and Star VC.\n\nIn July, the firm completed its US$410 million \u00adSeries B round of funding from investors led by CDH and Sailing Capital. The deal vaulted it to unicorn \u00adstatus with a valuation of US$1.5 billion.\n\n> START-UP SUCCESSES B3\n","686":"\u00a0\n The boss of Hong Kong-based Artificial Life, Eberhard Schoneburg, is a bit sensitive about his \"girl\", a debutante who is already world famous even before meeting anyone. The German-born polymath-philosopher, mathematician, computer scientist, author and businessman brooks no criticism of his cyber -girlfriend, who will be officially launched at the 3G World Congress and Exhibition at the Convention Centre today.\n By now, you have probably heard all about Vivienne, with whom you can have a cyber-affair, sans sex, in a hyper-real graphic environment on your 3G phone.\n \"I don't like it when people say, 'Oh it's just a dumb chatter bot. It doesn't really understand anything and will never pass the Turing test',\" Mr Schoneburg says. (The Turing test decrees a computer program must be considered intelligent if, after interacting with it over a period of time, you cannot tell if you are dealing with a computer or a human.)\u00a0\n \"Artificial\u00a0Intelligence has been criticised since day one,\" Mr Schoneburg continues, \"mostly because of incompetent public writers who have collected their AI knowledge from reading three books ... who have no clue what they are writing about, and from tonnes of bad science fiction, where AI-driven robots kill and eat people...  it's just horrifying how dumb people can be.\n \"Why is it that reporters always have to find a negative edge? The V-Girl is 'not just a chat bot with high resolution graphics'. We have tried - within the boundaries of the current technical AI possibilities - to simulate life -like behaviour as much as possible. That's the edge - the chatting is just one small component of it.\"\n The former computer science professor is upset because he was asked if his girl was just the latest talk-back program in AI, sometimes referred to as \"chat bots\", which date back to the 1960s. Chat bots allow a human interlocutor to carry on a conversation within confined subjects.\n \"How would Alex Lo answer any of the following questions?\" he asks. \"What is the significance of the constant H in Einstein's theory? What was Schopenhauer's opinion about time and space? What is the rate of mutations in human genes? Why is the global economy not a chaotic system? What is the closest galaxy that does not contain a super nova? How does your brain work? What is the strength of the magnetic field of the Earth at the equator? How does your body grow from one cell into the 3-D structure? And what is intelligence?\n \"I can list 100,000 more questions of which you wouldn't even be able to guess at the right answers! So, does this make you a dumb chatter bot?\"\n Actually most men probably would be intimidated by women who know the answers to these questions, so that is no flaw on the part of the cyber-girl, who presumably is strong in other departments, so much so that it has been shortlisted, along with two other finalists, for the mobile games section of the Ericsson Mobile Applications Award 2004, the Oscars of the telecommunication world, which set a pretty high standard.\n Still, Mr Schoneburg knows his history and doesn't deny his cyber-girl has a long linage dating back to Eliza, if not before. Eliza who? Several well-known \"personalities\" to emerge from the turbulent 1960s were not even human. Eliza, Parry and Racter are the precursors of so-called chat bots.\n Written by a young MIT computer scientist, Joseph Weizenbaum, Eliza simulates a psychotherapist. Anyone who knows anything about it would not describe it as intelligent.\n It responds to key words with canned questions or comments, and it works best if you confine yourself to talking about yourself and your problems. Outside of these subjects, you would quickly realise your interlocutor is about as dumb as any automated answering machine. (You can chat by text-messaging with Eliza at www-ai.ijs.si\/eliza\/eliza.html.)\n But it was enough to fool a lot of people in the US at the time; when the truth came out, so many people were upset at Mr Weizenbaum that he almost got sacked from his job. In a famous interview around that time, Bob Dylan mimicked the program by turning the last few words of the interviewing reporter into questions and throwing them back at her, much to her intense annoyance and frustration. She was obviously not in on the joke.\n Eliza was rapidly followed by Parry, a young paranoid patient, and Racter, an insane raconteur. Both worked pretty much like their predecessor. Parry talks like a paranoid chatterbox, and colours all his \"conversations\" with the subtext, and sometimes explicit assertions, that the mafia is out to get him. You can make Eliza and Parry talk to one another - the ensuring conversations can be hilarious. Some extensive samples are available at www. stanford.edu\/group\/SHR\/4-2\/text\/ dialogues.html.\n Meanwhile, Racter has been described as an \"artificially insane raconteur\" that can talk about anything under the sun. It even writes poetry. Here is an example:\n Awareness is like consciousness. Soul is like spirit.\n But soft is not like hard and weak is not like strong.\n A mechanic can be both soft and hard,\n A stewardess can be both weak and strong.\n This is called philosophy or a world-view.\n Thus was born the idea of chat bots, programs that can talk back to you and make you think you are dealing with real humans. One particularly famous one from the late 1970s is called Cyrus, which simulated the personality of Cyrus Vance, former US president Jimmy Carter's secretary of state, by continuously updating new data about Vance from news wires.\n There are also expert systems, some of which have chat-bot features, which can answer most questions you want to know in a specific field. The famous Lunar can answer almost everything about moon rocks. But you can easily make it go haywire by asking a fringe question like this: Did the cold war cause the space race and accelerate the exploration of the moon and its rock features?\n Meanwhile, US space agency Nasa has an expert system to advise engineers to arrange up to 10,000 distinct engineering operations in the preparation of launching a space shuttle. Then there is Mycin, which statistically carries out better diagnosis and treatment for infectious diseases of the blood than human experts.\n A previous company of Mr Schoneburg's has developed an interactive Einstein that answers questions about relativity theory, and Artificial Life has Hello Kitty with a licence from Sanrio to teach English. With all these specialised programs, as long as you confine yourself to talking about the specific field, you would think you are talking to a professor - until you switch subjects and get bizarre results.\n Daniel Dennett, an eminent cognitive scientist and philosopher, has a special respect for Parry, designed by Kenneth Colby, a psychiatrist and programmer. \"To my knowledge, the only serious and interesting attempt by any program designer to win even a severely modified Turing test has been Colby's,\" he wrote in his 1998 book Brainchildren.  No program currently available can pass this test, according to Mr Dennett.\n But Mr Schoneburg argues it is achievable in principle. \"The only reason why no program has yet managed to pass the test is not a logical impossibility - it's because nobody that works in this field has the time and resources to do it. It's mostly either university labs or small corps like us,\" he says.\n \"If we would only spend 1\/100,000 of the global military budget on this task, a program would have long passed the test. It's all a matter of complexity and completeness of the knowledge bases.\"\n A typical and well-developed bot may know about 50,000 to 100,000 subjects and can avoid tapping into verbal traps in these fields. To pass the Turing test, Mr Schoneburg estimates that a bot would have to master at least several millions subjects, including general day-to-day knowledge.\n Vivienne can handle about 30,000 subjects, but will be learning at a rate of up to 3,000 new subjects a month to widen her \"world knowledge\" database.\n \"She currently can only speak English, but is being taught Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, Italian and Spanish - how is that as a measure of intelligence?\" he asks.\n \"And she will be teasing but no hardcore sex talks. That's not our audience - and by the way, the worst Turing test for intelligence is sex talk, because it is the easiest to simulate because it is usually dumb and you can always avoid direct answers like: 'Can I have sex with you tonight?' Bot: 'Maybe, depends how you behave towards me.' This can go on for hours and it's no test of intelligence.\"\n Vivienne combines the conversational prowess of smart bots and a high -resolution 3D-graphic world of computer games, so you can chat her up in a bar, visit her ultra-modern apartment and take her out to dinner.\n But lonely cell phone users still have to wait until the middle of next month, when local 3G carriers will be ready to hook them up with the virtual 20 -something computer graphic designer who works at - you guessed it - Artificial Life: an in-joke, as the fake girl no doubt has some of the personality traits of the group of programmers under Mr Schoneburg's supervision.\n","687":"Artificial\u00a0intelligence will play an important part in China's supply-side reform as the cutting-edge technology is expected to reshape various sectors such as retail, manufacturing and healthcare, top company executives said Monday at a forum of the fourth World Internet Conference.\u00a0\nRobots work at a restaurant in Lanzhou, Northwest China's Gansu province, Dec 7, 2015. [Photo\/IC]\nArtificial\u00a0intelligence will play an important part in China's supply-side reform as the cutting-edge technology is expected to reshape various sectors such as retail, manufacturing and healthcare, top company executives said Monday at a forum of the fourth World Internet Conference.\nRobin Li, CEO of Baidu Inc, China's largest search engine provider, said in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, that in comparison with the mobile internet technology that has revolutionized consumer services, AI will exert a far bigger influence over how enterprises run their businesses.\n\"For instance, Baidu is leveraging AI to help supermarkets better manage their supply of fresh food by analyzing and predicting which products are most popular,\" Li said.\nAccording to him, such solutions have effectively reduced the food waste ratio and boosted profit growth at pilot stores. AI can also be used to help coal mining companies step up precautionary measures against accidents and assist steel mills to automatically check product defects.\nLei Jun, founder and CEO of Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi Inc, said internet companies can leverage the huge number of users and devices they have accumulated in the past several years to find new growth momentum with AI.\n\"A key factor in the digital economy is integration. Only by integrating AI with various sectors can we give full display of the technological advancements the world has made,\" Lei said.\nXiaomi said it has over 85 million consumer electronic devices on its internet of things platform as of November.\nFu Sheng, CEO of Cheetah Mobile, a major mobile app publisher in China, said it is very important to have abundant application scenarios to promote the development of AI.\n\"Technology must be efficiently integrated into products. AI is reshaping industries which used to be far away from the internet,\" Fu said.\nBy applying image recognition technologies to Live.me, a livestreaming platform which is ranked as the most popular social-networking app on the Google Play app store in the United States, Cheetah Mobile said it can now automatically track user-generated content. The move has greatly boosted work efficiency and lowered labor costs.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/8\/151237769359.jpg\nd8cb8a14fbeb1b8f50bf06.jpg\n","688":"China's artificial\u00a0intelligence-focused startups received record financing of 19.3 billion yuan ($2.87 billion) in the first half of 2017, with the mid and late-stage deals dominating the period, a report said on Wednesday.\u00a0\nRobots attract visitors at an industry expo in Beijing. CHEN XIAOGEN \/ FOR CHINA DAILY\nChina's artificial\u00a0intelligence-focused startups received record financing of 19.3 billion yuan ($2.87 billion) in the first half of 2017, with the mid and late-stage deals dominating the period, a report said on Wednesday.\nIt predicted that the industry is very likely to \"enter an adjustment period\" in the next half year.\nAccording to a report issued by itjuzi.com, a Chinese website dedicated to data on tech investments, the number of deals to AI-enabled startups in the country reached 96 in the first six months. Top verticals for the period include healthcare, automobile, security, finance, logistics and warehouse.\nAI in intelligent robotics is the leading category for deals in 2017 so far, which accounts for nearly one-third of total deals. Companies leveraging natural language processing, a subfield of AI, received most capital.\nThe report comes amid the AI-investment spree nationwide. In July, Chinese government released a national plan aiming to grow its core AI industries to 150 billion yuan by 2020, 400 billion yuan by 2025, and 1 trillion yuan by 2030.\nPart of the reason behind the forecast of \"adjustment period\" lies in the imbalance in cash flows between the well-funded and early-stage companies, said the report citing latest figures.\nAlmost 60 percent of the capital was invested in the top five companies in terms of funding. By contrast, only 21 percent flowed to AI-related startups in series-A stage and earlier, which are still relatively nascent and account for 77 percent of total deals.\nSome businesses in computer vision and image, cloud computing equipment, natural language processing and aided driving are poised for growth. Those focusing their efforts on sensor components, laser radar, and technological platform are still at early stage. \nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/26\/150172927706.jpg\nd8cb8a14fbeb1aecba171f.jpg\n","691":"Tencent Holdings, the operator of China's largest social network, has appointed machine-learning expert to head its artificial intelligence lab, joining competitors in making a push to claim the next frontier in Internet technology.\u00a0\nZhang Tong, an expert in big data, and the former head of Baidu Inc's big data lab, has been named to the post, according to a Tencent statement.

We should use the machine in an innovative way to solve human problems.\"\nZuckerberg said AI technology could prove useful in areas such as medicine and hands-free driving, but it was hard to teach computers common sense. Humans had the ability to learn and apply that knowledge to problem-solving, but computers could not do that.\nTheir meeting was one of the most anticipated sessions at annual economic summit organised by the China Development Research Foundation, under the Development Research Centre of the State Council. Attendees at the three-day forum, which began yesterday, include China's top politicians and business leaders.\nZuckerberg said virtual reality would be another focus of innovation in the next five to 10 years and would drive consumption. He said Facebook's virtual reality headset, Oculus Rift, would be launched this year, while \"virtual reality mobile devices\" could also be a trend in the future.\nMa said he knew little about the technology, but was happy to sell the devices on Alibaba'se-commerce platform Taobao.\nMa said he expected a tough time for China in the next two to three years as the economy was declining. \"Now is the most painful period, after a wonderful time over the past 30 years.

Global researcher IDC has projected a compound annual growth rate of 60 percent for AI hardware-related revenue over the next five years.\n\"Internet of things is evolving from 'connecting everything' to 'making things intelligent',\" Hu Yali, an analyst at CITIC Securities Research Center, said in a report.\nShe noted that the upgrading will enable smart watches, refrigerators, cups and other hardware not only to link up and upload data onto the internet, it can also analyze and respond to data itself.\nIntelliFusion focuses on visual information processing which, in Chen's words, is the \"Achilles' heel of cloud computing\" because its quantity is huge and its content is irregular.\nThe solution he and his team proposed is to separate part of big data analysis from cloud to terminal. Taking facial recognition as an example, chips in cameras can pre-process video data, detect and extract targeted facial characteristics, and translate them into arrays of binary data, which will be uploaded to the cloud for final processing.\nThe method can lower the demand for network bandwidth, the cost of cloud processing and, more importantly, protect privacy as we can store only characteristic arrays in the cloud, instead of videos and images, said Chen.\nData privacy protection is one of the toughest challenges, warned Zhang Zhuo, director of big data and AI at IDC China, adding that it can seriously damage a company's value and brand.\nHe said there's an urgent need for regulations and legislation, suggesting that AI technology companies establish an eco-system with terminal devices and other related companies to protect users' personal information.\nThe startup designed its first visual intelligence system \"DeepEye\" last year and applied it to the city's public security system, allowing it to locate a suspect among a million people in just one second, based on deep learning, integrated circuits and big data technologies.\nBuilding up a security system is one of the most important trends in AI hardware development. Besides fixed cameras, it can integrate with wearable devices for patrolmen and send out an automatic alarm, said Zhang.\nIntelliFusion is expected to release DeepEye II and tape out an innovatively architectured processor chip IPU next year, which could be applied in more AI products, such as robots, drones and intelligent manufacturing equipment.\nRobots will not only see the world, but also understand it, said Chen, a processor design expert with 10 years' overseas working experience in ZTE USA and Freescale Semiconductor Ltd.\nAnother cofounder of IntelliFusion, Tian Dihong, specializes in visual computing and had led tech teams at Samsung and Cisco.\nThe two entrepreneurs had worked together at the Center for Signal and Image Processing, Georgia Institute of Technology, 15 years ago.\nThey returned to Shenzhen in 2014 and got the startup off the ground after having secured hundreds of millions of yuan in capital support from various investors, such as the Chinese mainland's top seed fund Zhen Fund.\ngrace@chinadailyhk.com\n(HK Edition 12\/22\/2016 page9)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/67\/148237528278.jpg\n00221917e13e19c5793b48.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/1\/148237528462.jpg\n00221917e13e19c5794249.jpg\n","696":"After the AlphaGo program from Google parent Alphabet beat the mainland's top Go player Ke Jie in May last year, the then 19-year-old was in tears, declaring his opponent \"god-like\".\n\u00a0\nTwo months later, Beijing announced an ambitious plan to overtake the United States in artificial\u00a0intelligence by 2030.\n\nCoincidence? Perhaps, but it is easy to see how the prospects of losing the AI race to the US would scare the wits out of Beijing.\n\nBeijing's AI pronouncement has since been called a new Sputnik moment for Washington - a wake-up call akin to Russia's launch of the first space probe in 1957, which pushed the US to double down on military and aerospace technology and culminated in the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969.\n\nLeaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Tesla found\u00ad\u00ader Elon Musk have said who\u00adever wins the AI race will \"rule the world\".\n\nBut there are two races - a dash to develop human-like AI, or artificial general intelli\u00adgence (AGI), and a mara\u00adthon to discover artificial super\u00adintelligence that surpasses the best human brains in virtually every field.\n\nIn the meantime, the warm-up is \"narrow AI\", which has been developed by Chinese and US firms to do specific tasks ranging from autonomous driving to teaching children their alphabets.\n\nUntil AGI is realised, each country will dominate in the narrow AI fields that play to their strengths. Chinese AI start-ups such as Yitu Technology and iFlyTek are at the leading edge of facial and voice recognition, respectively - applications embraced in China but resisted by privacy advocates in the US.\n\nAs the world's strongest military power, the US is likely to dominate in AI applications for drones and robots.\n\nAI experts believe the US is ahead in developing AGI, which is the race China is throwing its weight behind now but may be too far behind to catch up in time.\n\nIn terms of investment, US$2.6 billion of capital has flowed into China's AI sector in the 41 \/2 years to June last year, about 14 per cent of the amount going into the US, according to Wuzhen Institute and NetEase.\n\nThere is a good chance China could win the AI marathon given its sheer size (population and economy) and stamina for playing the long game, a characteristic lacking in the US where policies can change after every presidential election.\n\nAI experts believe a break\u00adthrough in superintelligence is decades away.\n\nHowever, winning the marathon would be a pyrrhic victory for China, which does not tolerate dissent of any kind. Consider why Chinese censors ban supernatural stories from television and films - because they convey the idea of powerful forces that it cannot control.\n\nLast year, an AI-powered chatbot was pulled from a web platform after it gave inappropriate answers. Question: What is the Chinese dream? Answer: To live in America.\n\nOops. Better not try that with a superintelligent AI, which would view the smartest humans the same way we view apes today.\n\nStill, knowing the Americans - not to mention Russians, Israelis and Canadians - are in the same race for superintelligence, Beijing must compete to win even at the risk of unleashing a power it cannot control.\n\nWhat exactly could a superintelligent AI do that could enable its inventor to rule the world?\n\nAI experts agree its first task will be designing a much smarter version of itself. Then anything is possible.\n\nInvent a new low-cost, clean energy source. Check.\n\nDevise a strategy to disable an opponent's military superiority. Check.\n\nImprove medical care to extend the life of the country's leaders. Check.\n\nScary stuff if you do not trust the machine.\n\nThat is why AI experts talk about the \"god slave\" scenario, in which the first to develop artificial superintelligence will keep it \"locked up\" for fear of losing control - something a totalitarian government is more likely to do than, say, a Google.\n\nPutting aside the question of why such a superior intellect could not escape from human-imposed confines in the first place, such a strategy would limit its capabilities against an equivalent superintelligence from other nations.\n\nIf China wins the marathon but embraces the god-slave approach, it will effectively be ceding the race to the runner-up.\n\nWho then rules the world? Perhaps the opposing superintelligent entities can compete in a Go match. Winner takes all - literally.\n","697":"The luxury goods sector is embracing cutting-edge technologies as fashion boutiques turn to virtual reality and artificial intelligence to woo shoppers.\nThe opportunity to experience exotic new worlds through a headset is believed to have broad-based consumer appeal.\nFrench fashion giant Christian Dior has employed virtual-reality headsets to give buyers an immersive behind-the-scenes glimpse of its latest runway shows in Paris and Milan. Without jetting off to Europe, visitors can visit local boutiques and don a virtual-reality headset, known as Dior Eyes, to enjoy a front-row runway experience of the maison's ready-to-wear haute couture collections.\u00a0\nFashion labels Balenciaga and Tommy Hilfiger are also embracing the technology. Tommy Hilfiger will enable visitors to its Regent Street shop in London to enjoy an in-store virtual-reality experience tied to its autumn runway presentation.\nVirtual shopping malls a further threat to mainland China's dwindling department stores\n\"Through virtual reality, we're now able to bring our one-of-a-kind fashion show to the retail setting,\" Tommy Hilfiger said in a company statement.\nThe US fashion label said the use of virtual reality would \"elevate\" the traditional shopping experience for its smartphone-wielding clientele.\nThe likes of Dior, Balenciaga and Tommy Hilfiger believe consumers are not coming to their boutiques only to purchase, but rather for entertainment. The evolving dynamic is poised to be a game changer for the US$1.15 trillion luxury goods industry at a time when it is struggling with single-digit growth rates.\nThe key is to make affluent clients feel thrilled about their time spent in a luxury boutique.\n\"You need to build an emotional link to buyers using technology tools as they are now becoming more tech-savvy and sophisticated,\" Francois Arpels, a managing partner with private equity firm IndEU Capital and shareholder of his family business Van Cleef & Arpels, told the South China Morning Post.\nA 30-year veteran of the luxury industry, Arpels started his career as a member of the executive committee of the Paris luxury powerhouse, which itself stood out as an innovator with the launch of its namesake fine fragrance four decades ago - the first product crossover attempt by a premier jeweller.\n\"They want the experience that differentiates themselves from others,\" Arpels said.\nVirtual reality could bring catalogues to life and showcase how a particular product might appear in different settings. A high-end customer, for instance, might want to have an idea of whether her tailor-made gown looks good in wedding photos featuring the Eiffel Tower as background.\n\"When it comes to the consumer, some would say their expectations are becoming limitless, whether it's instant delivery, intuitive commerce or compelling store experiences,\" said Lucie Greene, director of the innovation group at J. Walter Thompson.\nThat means cutting-edge technologies once reserved for gaming are bound to become ubiquitous over time. According to Google statistics, searches for virtual reality jumped six times in 2016 from a year earlier.\nGlobal luxury brands are also looking towards artificial intelligence to improve customer service.\nOne example is the smart mirror, which has drawn interest from Burberry and other design houses.\nHow virtual reality technology could change the property market in China\nUnited States-based designer brand Rebecca Minkoff saw customers at its Los Angeles flagship store order more items from fitting rooms equipped with \"magic mirrors\", which provide advice on how to mix and match garments.\n\"[Artificial intelligence] ... is poised to disrupt nearly every industry over the next decade by supplementing human intuition,\" said a J. Walter Thompson report released last year.\nThere are signs that initial efforts by some fashion brands are starting to pay off.\nIn a bid to turn around its beleaguered China business, Hugo Boss launched an interactive campaign last summer on the popular Chinese social media app WeChat, which gave users a virtual-reality experience intended to shed light on the German menswear's holiday collection.\nThe app took visitors to a virtual Hugo Boss boutique where they could participate in various tasks. It also invited users to provide profile data, which could be used to bolster the company's customer databases.\nLast month, Hugo Boss saw its Frankfurt-listed shares rally after its revenue in Asia grew by a currency-adjusted 5 per cent in the fourth quarter following a 20 per cent surge in mainland China sales. The result compared with a 3 per cent revenue contraction in the third quarter.\nWhile the latest creations such as magic mirrors and online sizing tools can merge the personalised experience of the physical stores into the digital world, analysts note that it is crucial for retailers to pick the technologies that resonate with their target customers.\n\"Older women are particularly interested in interactive mirrors in changing rooms,\" said Tamara Sender, a senior fashion analyst with market researcher Mintel.\nRetailers that catered to an older clientele could \"benefit from investing in this technology\", she added.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

But artificial intelligence is integral to business growth, product security and optimization, according to Qi Yuan, a vice-president and chief data scientist at Ant Financial.\nFor Ant Financial, which is valued at US$60 billion following a US$4.5 billion fundraising round last year, AI is the key driver for its business. It's been applied to all of its operations which includes loans, wealth management, insurance services and rural finance.\u00a0\n\"At Ant Financial, we say AI solves problems,\" Qi said in an interview in Hangzhou. \"In finance, the main problems are credit and risk management.\"\nAlibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post and operator of the world's largest online shopping platform is one of the biggest private enterprise investors in AI, driving China's programme to catch up with the United Sates in investing in machine learning and natural language processing. Alibaba already uses an AI algorithm on its Taobao and Tmall platforms to identify counterfeit products.\nLast month, Ant Financial launched an AI-driven, image-recognition system to help the investigators of vehicle insurance claims do their jobs faster and better.\nAccording to Ant Financial, exterior damage claims make up about 60 per cent of the 45 million private vehicle insurance claims filed in China every year. In a demonstration, Ant Financial's algorithm took 6 seconds to assess the damage in 12 different cases, whereas human investigators needed over 6 minutes to reach a verdict over the same claims.\nBoth humans and machine came to the same conclusion that one of the 12 cases would require further investigation.\n\"What we have now [the algorithm] is equivalent to someone with 10 years of experience,\" Qi said. The damage assessment system is currently available to insurers, but the company has plans to offer the product to car owners within a year.\nAI is also key to data protection and to detect fraud. \"We use machine learning to detect frauds,\" Qi said. \"This would increase of the costs of committing a fraud. And the costs would be so much higher than the actual benefits, and as such it deter frauds.\"\nAnt Financial, which currently employs over 6,000 people, has been growing fast, particularly in the area of customer services. \"At this speed of growth, we'll need tens of thousands of people working in customer services, and this is not possible,\" said Qi.\n\"When I moved to Ant two years ago, I was the only one working in AI,\" Qi said. \"Within two years, the operation has grown to 300 people.\"\nThe company launched a AI-powered chatbot in 2015, and since it has seen a significant improvement in the number of calls handled by the customer services. \"This year, we didn't take that many calls because the chat assistant was doing most of the job,\" said Qi.\nQi, who taught at Purdue University before taking up his first job with Alibaba in China, describes Ant Financial as an entrepreneurial company and AI is like \"water\", the key to supporting the development. \"There are more venues and applications in China [for AI}. There are also many talented people here,\" Qi said. \"AI in the next 10 years will be a leading force not only in China but in the rest of the world.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

This year, the company said it expected to boost R&D investment at an even higher rate after reporting a rebound in annual \u00adoperating profit on the back of its mainstay search operations.\n\n\"As we enter 2018, we will continue to strengthen Baidu's search business, fuel feed's growth and differentiate iQiyi with AI,\" Li said yesterday, referring to its video-streaming unit. \"We also look \u00adforward to further strengthening our position in autonomous \u00addriving and conversational AI.\"\n\nLi, who has an estimated wealth of US$16.2 billion, has pushed the company he founded into AI in a bet that machines will take over many tasks now performed by humans.\n\nBeijing has identified AI and related sciences as a national \u00adpriority and released official \u00adtargets to build supporting \u00adinfrastructure.\n\nGoing into the second year of making AI its focus, Baidu is beginning to see some fruits from the investment, although significant contributions from those businesses remain some years off, according to Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research.\n\n\"We can now see the start of AI monetisation,\" Boodry said. \"There should be incremental contributions in areas like personal assistants and improvements in ad targeting, but we may not have a clear view on how these drive revenue.\"\n\nIn an interview with Time magazine published last month, Li touted China's role in AI development, describing the advantages of the country's massive population and vast quantities of data needed to train AI systems.\n\nBaidu will see its first autonomous vehicle, a minibus produced with Xiamen King Long United Automotive Industry, hit the market in the second half of this year.\n\nThe firm also has high-definition mapping needed to enable self-driving vehicles, although the full potential of that business will not be realised until perhaps after 2020, or when regulations allow for the cars to be used on public roads and their number increases, according to Boodry.\n\nMore opportunities to apply and commercialise its AI tech\u00adnology are set to come, according to Lu Qi, Baidu's chief operating officer.\n\nThe self-driving vehicle platform, called Apollo, has more than 90 partners, including BAIC Group, Chery and Anhui Jiang\u00adhuai Automobile.\n\nBaidu also signed an agreement to help develop the new Xiongan economic zone into a smart city powered by smart transport, voice assistance and cloud computing.\n\nIn the area of voice assistants, Baidu introduced its first AI- enabled hardware, the raven H smart speaker. It has formed strategic partnerships with Qualcomm and Nvidia for its voice recognition software, DuerOS.\n\nIn a recent forum in Beijing, Li said the company started to deploy in AI about six or seven years ago.\n\n\"Now that AI has become \u00admature enough to have some use in the market, we feel relatively more relaxed, feel that this day has finally come,\" he said.\n\niQiyi has submitted a draft \u00adregistration to the US Securities and Exchange Commis\u00adsion for a proposed initial public offering.\n","701":"Some of the biggest banks in Hong Kong are catching up with the artificial intelligence rush by launching smart chatbots, in a bid to serve technology-savvy customers and cut costs.\n\nHSBC Holdings, Standard Chartered and Hang Seng Bank are among the players that have recently announced their launch of chatbots to serve customers.\n\u00a0\nChatbots are machines that use AI technologies such as \u00adnatural language processing to answer queries from customers.\n\nThe lenders, however, want to give them a human touch, which is why HSBC named its chatbot Amy, while Hang Seng calls its \u00advirtual assistants Haro and Dori.\n\nThe moves came as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's banking regulator, launched a number of measures over the past two years to encourage banks to develop financial technology. They are encouraged to develop innovative products or technology to cut operating costs and \u00adoffer better customer service.\n\nChatbots will help save global banks more than US$8 billion per year by 2022, according to a report by Juniper Research. The report also estimates a chatbot inquiry will save about four minutes compared with traditional call centres.\n\nPaul Sin, a consulting partner with Deloitte China and leader of Deloitte's Asia-Pacific blockchain laboratory, said with chatbots handling 80 per cent of inquiries, it should be much faster if one customer really needed to reach a human agent.\n\nThe corporate banking unit of HSBC, Hong Kong's largest bank by assets, launched Amy, the first chatbot of its kind in the city, to answer basic questions such as how to open an account.\n\n\"When we take out our smartphone, we spend more time in text messaging through social media than we use it as a phone. This is why we believe customers would like to use a chatbot,\" said Daniel Chan, the head of business banking at HSBC Hong Kong.\n\nCustomers wanted answers immediately from a chatbot instead of waiting even 10 seconds to reach someone in a call centre, Chan said.\n\nHang Seng introduced Haro and Dori to its retail banking \u00adcustomers earlier this month, promising human-like conversations fuelled by machine learning technologies.\n\nHaro, available online and through the bank's mobile app, will handle general inquiries about products and services, such as providing product information and \u00adcalculating mortgage payments, while Dori searches for dining \u00addiscounts and makes \u00adrecommendations based on \u00adcustomers' \u00adpreferences.\n\nDori is embedded in Facebook's instant messaging app and is said to function similarly to \u00adApple's Siri or Google Assistant.\n\nStandard Chartered plans to launch its chatbot in the second quarter as it is still waiting for \u00adregulatory approval.\n\nThe chatbot can talk with \u00adclients in text messages and process more than 80 per cent of \u00adrequests. When stuck, it will transfer the \u00adinquiry to human agents, according to Zor Gorelov, the chief executive and co-founder of Kasisto, which will power the chatbot.\n\nFinding the right personnel to maintain chatbot services is among the challenges in their \u00adsuccessful introduction.\n\n\"Once new technology is deployed in production, it needs people to maintain the platform. Relying on a small fintech [firm] is not realistic and \u00adrecruiting from the market is difficult,\" Sin said.\n\nLiability issues have seen banks take a cautious approach in their fintech plans. Bank of \u00adAmerica, the largest bank by \u00adassets in the US, is still testing \u00adErica - a chatbot that allows communication via text and voice.\n\nAccording to Sin, clients cannot sue a bot for errors in transaction or investment execution.\n\nMeanwhile, banks can choose to conduct trials of their fintech initiatives, meaning they can launch a smart bot with a limited number of participants under the HKMA's sandbox scheme.\n","702":"China's digital economy, already home to the world's largest population of internet and smartphone users, is likely to create 415 million jobs by 2035, bolstering technology's share to 48 per cent of gross domestic product, according to forecasts by the Boston Consulting Group and AliResearch Institute.\nLow-skilled, menial and repititive jobs will be replaced by robots, artificial intelligence and intuitive technologies such as touch screens, as well as voice and facial recognition software. Technology would displace menial jobs but would also create new opportunities, the report said.\u00a0\nAlibaba offers to create 1 million US jobs in Trump meeting\nThe forecasts come at a time when AI invested by two of the world's largest internet search operators is increasingly showing its mettle in competitions against humans. Google's DeepMind has developed AlphaGo, which triumphed over human players of Go in 60 matches in China, while Baidu is entering its AI bot in game shows to solve complex problems.\nAI would replace some jobs, including researchers, AliResearch head Gao Hongbing said.\n\"There will be AI-powered think tanks and some basic research will be done by machines,\" he said. Humans would be added to the workforce, using their skills in certain areas to monetise their know-how via online platforms, he said.\nGermany offers a good parallel experience. The BCG study found drones and automation would remove 610,000 factory floor jobs in Germany but by 2025 advances in technology would lead to 960,000 new opportunities in information technology and communications.\n\"Germany's Siemens has about 300,000 workforce, which means the new technology will wipe out two Siemens but at the same time create three Siemens. Think about that,\" said Ruan Fang, partner and managing director of BCG .\nAs machines become smarter, people are able to work no matter where they are in a more flexible way via the internet. AliResearch, a think tank affiliated with e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, predicted that about 400 million people in China would be self-employed through online platforms, waving goodbye to the traditional eight-hour working mode by 2036.\nWHY 2017 WILL BE ASIA'S YEAR FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nFor example, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing lets 15 million people who have driving licenses make money by offering services via its platforms. Alibaba's online marketplace Taobao, which has 8,000 employees, facilitates the business of hundreds of thousands of suppliers and three million delivery staff. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nHao Jian, the chief consultant at China's major online recruiting firm Zhaopin.com, said he had witnessed the same trend as people no longer needed to be employed by a certain company; they could simply find project-based work opportunities online.\n\"The demand for part-time jobs enjoyed the most rapid growth - 113 per cent year-on-year [last year] compared with the other 60 job categories Zhaopin has,\" he said.\nHe said AI was good at finding patterns by analysing massive amounts of data.\n\"But jobs that require creativeness, involve emotions and tend to break rules rather than follow rules can never be replaced by machines,\" he added.\nTHE MACHINES ARE COMING: CHINA'S ROLE IN THE FUTURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nThe report foresaw that some low-skilled and repetitive tasks would be replaced by hi-tech equipment and technologies such as touch screens, robots and facial recognition without giving exact numbers of job cuts in the future. But the report emphasised that job opportunities created by the digital economy more than compensated for those positions that would disappear.\nThe report cited a World Bank report which estimated 55 to 77 per cent of China's low-skilled workforce could be replaced by technology, while employees had to cultivate skills and know-how that would not be easily replaced by digital technologies.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

It is similar to the real world, where not all problems are laid out, and the difficulty in figuring out human behavior was one of the main reasons why poker was considered immune to machines.\n\"The best AI's ability to do strategic reasoning with imperfect information has now surpassed that of the best humans,\" said Tuomas Sandholm, the professor of computer science at CMU who created Libratus with PhD student Noam Brown, on Wednesday.\nThe victory prompted inquiries from companies around the world seeking Libratus' algorithm for problem solving, which, according to Sandholm, \"can be used in any situation where information is incomplete, including business negotiation, military strategy, cybersecurity and medical treatment\".\nOne of the main reasons for Libratus' victory was the machine's ability to out bluff humans.\n\"The computer can't win at poker if it can't bluff,\" said Frank Pfenning, head of the Computer Science Department at CMU.\n\"Developing an AI that can do that successfully is a tremendous step forward scientifically and has numerous applications,\" he added. \"Imagine that your smartphone will someday be able to negotiate the best price on a new car for you.

The lab is the brain power behind Baidu's autonomous vehicles, and is entering its AI bot as a contestant in China's popular game show Super Brain to solve problems.\nAlibaba Group Holdings, operator of the world's largest online shopping platforms and owner of the South China Morning Post, has an AI bot programme with 600 analytics models that can process 100 million pieces of data per second. This bot scans more than 10 million product listings on Alibaba's Taobao platform everyday, helping to identify counterfeit products and vendors.\nMore than 800 conterfeiters were sent to Chinese jails last year due to the Big Data analysis of Alibaba's anti-counterfeit campaign, the company's chief executive Daniel Zhang said in December.\nTencent Holdings, which runs China's largest mobile social network, has invested in AI to produce news articles for its site.\nArtificial\u00a0intelligence will be the focus of 2017, said Tian Zhiyong, chief strategy officer of Kr Space, the incubator unit of start-up service platform 36kr.com, in which Alibaba's affiliate Ant Financial is an investor.\n\"When China's labour and manufacturing costs rise, AI emerges as a solution, because AI-powered applications and robots can efficiently handle the bulk of those jobs that require repetition\" and menial work, he said.\nAI would be the investment frontier not only in the coming year but the next couple of years as it would be the technology for the future, Tian added.\nChina's AI fervour will continue this year, as companies seek breakthroughs in AI-powered applications, said Zhao Ziming, a senior analyst with Beijing-based research firm Analysys.\n\"AI is about the future and it needs long-term investment. In 2017, the technology will continue to draw investors and companies' interest,\" Zhao said.\nYet the fervour may subside, as rationality sets in. Angel investors and venture capital funds are likely to be more skeptical about the commercial prospects and business models behind the technology, Zhao said.\n\"It's still an unknown how AI technology can help companies generate cash,\" he said. \"Investors will expect to see more new AI applications that can shape the future of some business segments.\"\nClosely intertwined with AI is the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), referring to technology that connects everyday objects through the internet. Then there's also the Analysis of Things (AoT), which looks at the data derived from the interconnection of things to create new paradigms or business models.\n\"AI and IoT are able to complement each other, and together bring change to areas such as autonomous driving,\" Zhao said.\nThe field of artificial intelligence will attract more funding in the coming year, as it's the one single technology that no company in China or anywhere else can afford to miss, said UBS AG's chief investment officer Hyde Chen.\n\"Other than the large technology companies like Baidu, Alibaba or Tencent, small companies and startups are also working on bringing AI applications to different sectors,\" Chen said. \"Venture capital will likely see good investment opportunities.\"\nChen was also looking forward to seeing some breakthroughs in the use of virtual reality (VR), the technology that immerses a user in an imagined world with artificial sounds and images.\n\"VR can be used in quite a wide-range of areas, from video game to entertainment, and we see the coming trend of using VR in e-commerce, medical and others,\" Chen said.\nAlibaba has begun using VR technology, offerig a service called \"Buy+\" that allows online shoppers to browse the stores of Macy's, Costco and Target using VR headsets that cost 1 yuan each.\nHowever, investments in VR could already be overdone over the years, creating an investment bubble, said Chen.\n\"VR applications will continue to develop in 2017, but the investment spree started to slow down from the second half of 2016 as investors have become more rational, \" he said. \"They need to find some outstanding projects that can be developed into a profitable business models.\"\nClosely associated with VR is AR, or augmented reality, which blends the virtual world with the real.\n\"AR can be used in a number of sectors including medical, property and education, and I expect some breakthroughs in applications in 2017,\" Chen said. \"While investors have already poured a lot of money into VR, some investors may turn to AR.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Hong Kong banks have made tremendous progress in automating a range of services, helping cut overhead costs.\nIn addition some major banks have moved much of their backroom operations to low-cost bases on the Chinese mainland and other regional economies. Most consumers are doing their banking online to save time and money.\u00a0\nIt's all well and proper - except when something unexpected happens. This happened to me when I was living in Shanghai. One night, the bank's ATM machine from which I withdrew cash regularly refused to accept my Hong Kong bank cards. More alarming was that the printout from the machine showed there was no money in my account.\nI had to wait until the next day to call the bank and was told the Hong Kong government had introduced a new rule requiring the registration of bank cards before they could be used outside the special administrative region. It involved a simple process which could be completed online in minutes. But I had to spend a sleepless night wondering what happened to my savings before I could find someone at the bank to help sort things out.\nIndeed, bank customers are getting used to automation. But that doesn't mean they stop valuing the personal service and advice from bank staff. To satisfy customers' needs, banks in some developed economies are turning more and more to AI.\nA report from consultancy firm Accenture suggests AI will play an increasingly important role in the way banks interact with their customers. It's not talking about some kind of scientific vision. Some banks have already invested heavily in the technology and are ready to introduce the service within the next three years.\nAlan McIntyre of Accenture told the BBC that the technology of AI \"will actually help banking become a lot more personalized, (taking) banking back to the feeling that people had when there were more human interactions\".\nInstead of sitting down at the computer to log on the bank's website, a consumer can contact a chatbot at the bank on one of the social platforms to do a range of transactions such as getting balance information or making a money transfer. What's more, the robot at the other end of the line can offer advice and suggestions depending on the customer's needs.\nSome robots are programmed to detect the customer's mood and sense whether the customer is frustrated or happy with the service so it can react accordingly. Results of tests on robotic services at banks in various European cities have shown that it is well-received by customers. According to BBC, Swedbank's Nina web assistant now has an average of 30,000 conversations a month and can handle more than 350 different customer questions.\nIntelligent personal assistant is a technology that is already widely used in smartphones. They include Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Samsung's newly introduced Bixby. In other areas, Netflix, for instance, is using AI to learn viewers' habits and preferences and offer advice in the background.\nMcIntyre of Accenture told BBC that in researching for the report, he found consumers were surprisingly willing to accept robotic advice about banking products. As such, robots can be a cost-effective way to sell bank products in addition to their other functions.\nHong Kong banks simply cannot afford to ignore this new technology to service their customers, whose needs can no longer be fully satisfied by simple number-crunching machines.\nThe author is a veteran public affairs commentator.\n(HK Edition 04\/11\/2017 page8)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/71\/149187174840.jpg\nf04da2db11221a56639e03.jpg\n","710":"Some of the world's leading technology professionals have gathered for the third World Internet Conference, being held in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, and top of everyone's agenda is the booming growth of artificial intelligence (AI), as it continues to penetrate every aspect of business and daily life.\nFrom customer services to wealth management, to reshaping the jobs market by replacing low-skilled workers, the sector is growing at an unprecedented pace, said analysts gathered for the event.\u00a0\nBig names speaking during the three-day forum include Facebook's vice president Vaughan Smith and smartphone maker Huawei's chief executive Richard Yu. Senior officials from Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, are also attending.\nHyde Chen, an analyst with UBS' chief investment office, told the Post the biggest issue facing the image of the AI sector is balancing the numbers of those being put out of work by the technology, with the jobs being created in its development.\n\"Jobs with three characteristics are at high risk of being replaced: low-skilled roles, those doing repetitive tasks, and jobs that are predictable. AI [applications] will be doing these jobs in a more effective way in future,\" Chen said.\nThe Swiss bank has forecast that about 50 million to 75 million jobs will be affected or eventually be replaced by AI in the next few years globally.\n\"AI will also bring disruptive changes to industries such as manufacturing, retail and financial industries. So employers will raise their requirement and want more personalised staff who can be more creative and have unique talents,\" he said.\nCiting so-called \"robo-advisors\" as an example - a label for digitising asset management websites which offer financial guidance based on algorithms - Chen said their expansion shows how AI can provide automated advice, adding that many financial advisors in the retail banking sector are already using the technology.\nJobs in three characteristics are at high risk of being replaced: low-skilled roles, those doing repetitive tasks, and jobs that are predictable.

On the other hand, there could be chronic unemployment and an even wider income gap; human interaction could become a luxury, and the wealthy could live in walled cities, with robots serving as labor.\nOr, little might change.\u00a0\nA new survey released on Wednesday by the Pew Research Center's Internet Project and Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center found that, when asked about the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs, nearly 1,900 experts and other respondents were divided over what to expect 11 years from now.\nForty-eight percent said robots would kill more jobs than they create, and 52 percent said technology will create more jobs than it destroys.\nRespondents also varied widely when asked to elaborate on their expectations of jobs in the next decade. Some said that self-driving cars would be common, eliminating taxi cabs and long-haul truck drivers. Some said to expect the wealthy to live in seclusion, using robot labor. Others were more conservative, cautioning that technology never moves quite as fast as people expect, and humans aren't so easily replaceable.\n\"We consistently underestimate the intelligence and complexity of human beings,\" said Jonathan Grudin, principal researcher at Microsoft who recalls that 40 years ago people said advances in computer languages would kill programming jobs.\nEven as technology reduced some jobs, such as secretaries and telephone operators, it created new ones, including Web marketing jobs, Grudin said. And, as Grudin and other survey responders noted, 11 years isn't much time for significant changes to take place.\nAaron Smith, senior researcher with Pew, said the results were unusually divided. He noted that in similar surveys about the Internet over the past 12 years, there tended to be general consensus among the respondents, which included research scientists and a range of others, from business leaders to journalists.\nRespondents in this latest survey generally agreed that the education system is failing to teach the skills students need for the future. Smith said some survey respondents criticized the system for promoting memorization of tasks rather than creativity, teaching a \"Henry Ford education for a Mark Zuckerberg economy\".\nAlso, Smith said, some respondents concluded that jobs that don't require specifically human traits - such as empathy, ingenuity or resourcefulness - are at risk for being replaced, including low-skill blue collar jobs or even white-collar jobs that have people performing repetitive tasks.\nRespondents offered a few theories about what might happen if artificial intelligence takes over some positions and fewer jobs are created.\nJudith Donath, a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, foresees chronic mass unemployment and a society in which the wealthy live in \"walled cities, with robots providing the labor\".\nSome respondents see people returning to small-scale, hand production, and an appreciation would grow for products with the \"human touch\".

[Photo\/Xinhua]\nExperts say that the more repetitive a job is, the more likely it is to be done by robots. Skills required in the manufacturing sectors are relatively low and repetitive. In most factories, workers could be replaced by robots because they are repeating only one or two actions every day.\nWhile China is at the crossroads of upgrading labor-intensive industries for higher profits and efficiency, robots are the perfect choice for factory owners to replace humans, whose salaries have been rising in recent years.\nZhang Ruimin, CEO of China's leading home appliance company Haier Group, said that the company cut 16,000 employees last year. Among them, more than 6,000 were manufacturing workers replaced by robots.\n\"The robots can guarantee a long-time single-standard repetition of work, which is impossible for humans,\" he said.\nAnd more importantly, robots will not establish a union and go on strike for more pay or less hours.\n2.

Surgeons\nA hospital in Sichuan province uses an imported robotic surgical system to remove a patient's gallbladder for the first time. [Photo provided to China Daily]\nThe highly-respected profession of surgeon also faces replacement by robots.\nA reduction in post-surgery pain is one remarkable benefit of the robotic surgeons. The machine's arms bend and rotate at greater degrees than a human wrist, which makes its movements more precise and takes pressure off the patient's body.\nRobots first carried out surgery in 1993. In 2010, China approved the use of the da Vinci surgical system for operating theatres.\nBy the end of last year, a total of 3,079 da Vinci robots were operating around the world. China has 28 of them.\nOn Dec 8, Zhejiang People's Hospital used the da Vinci robot to remove a tumor from a patient from Mali. The robot has four arms and one endoscope system that can move 360 degrees inside a patient's body.\nThe robot was able to remove all of the malignant tissue around the tumor without destroying healthy tissue.\n9.

[Photo\/IC]\nThe scene after disasters such as earthquakes, chemical explosions or floods is always dangerous and complicated. The application of robots can reduce casualties among disaster relief workers, regularly injured by falling buildings or poisonous gas releases.\nThe first 48 hours are the golden time for rescuing victims after a disaster. Designed to lift heavy things and seek out survivors, robots can rescue survivors much faster than humans.\nChina has already developed a type of robot that can work in fire, water or even after a nuclear explosion. The robot, developed by Shanghai Jiaotong University, is set to be widely used in rescue work.\n10.

There is much to look forward to an alliance between a smartphone company and an AI company, he said.\u00a0\nThe goal is to foster a new mobile and AI ecosystem by leveraging Huawei's hiAI platform and Baidu Brain, a compendium of the company's AI assets and services, and combine hardware and software to provide global consumers with new smart service experiences, according to the two companies.\nThat would give Shenzhen-based Huawei, China's biggest smartphone brand, with an important edge in competing against Apple and other major players in the global mobile phone market, which will demand more devices with on-board AI capabilities over the next few years.\nBaidu is the \"most complementary match\" for Huawei, said Richard Yu Chengdong, chief executive of Huawei's consumer business group, adding that the pair will put natural language and image processing technologies into the future generation of intelligent phones.\nThe tie-up also comes as Huawei expects the industry to further consolidate. \"Most smartphone vendors would disappear due to intense competition,\" said Yu. \"Only few would survive, which requires the finest user experience.\"\nResearch firm Counterpoint Technology recently forecast that more than half a billion smartphones - about one in three - that will be shipped around the world in 2020 are expected to have AI capabilities at the chip set level.\nHuawei ready to test US market again with smartphone aimed at iPhone X\nNasdaq-listed Baidu, which runs the dominant online search service in China, and Huawei on Thursday pledged to bring \"a personalised smart life experience to consumers\" by collaborating on an AI-powered platform and related technologies, internet services and content, according to a joint statement.\nTheir strategic cooperation further intensifies efforts in China to build the level of its artificial intelligence development above those of the United States and other major economies.\nIn July, the Chinese government announced an initiative to foster a highly innovative and competitive domestic AI market, which it forecast to be worth about US$150 billion by 2030.\nThe cooperation with Huawei followed Baidu's AI pact with Xiaomi, which was announced in November, that involved developing advanced consumer electronics products powered by AI and connected to the internet of things.\nBaidu has been making an aggressive transition to becoming an AI-first technology company, while both Xiaomi and Huawei continue to sharpen their focus on smarter mobile devices.\nE-commerce services provider Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, the world's largest video games company, have also increased their own AI development programmes to keep pace with Baidu in this field. New York-listed Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nIn September, Huawei introduced its Kirin 970 chip to provide built-in AI capabilities on its new flagship smartphone, the Mate 10.\nChina's Baidu, Xiaomi in AI pact to create smart connected devices\n\"The Huawei Mate 10 is able to accomplish diverse computational tasks efficiently, thanks to the neural processing unit at the heart of the Kirin 970,\" said a Counterpoint report in October.\nThe Kirin 970 is the second AI-capable chip in the market, following Apple's A11 Bionic system-on-a-chip that was designed for the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X.\nDespite its headway in developing an AI chip, Huawei was expected to remain behind Apple in this new arena.\nCounterpoint said Apple is likely to lead the world's AI-capable chip market through 2020 as its Bionic chip gets adopted across its whole portfolio of devices.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

The letter warned:  \"Autonomous weapons select and engage targets without human intervention. They might include, for example, armed quadcopters that can search for and eliminate people meeting certain pre-defined criteria, but do not include cruise missiles or remotely piloted drones for which humans make all targeting decisions. \u00a0\n\"Artificial\u00a0intelligence [AI] technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is - practically if not legally - feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high: autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms.\"\nTheir main concern is a  new kind of global arms race or cold war on the basis of intelligent, autonomous robots: \"The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting. \n\"If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapons development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow. \n\"Unlike nuclear weapons, they require no costly or hard-to-obtain raw materials, so they will become ubiquitous and cheap for all significant military powers to mass-produce. \n\"It will only be a matter of time until they appear on the black market and in the hands of terrorists, dictators wishing to better control their populace, warlords wishing to perpetrate ethnic cleansing, etc.\n\"Autonomous weapons are ideal for tasks such as assassinations, destabilising nations, subduing populations and selectively killing a particular ethnic group. \n\"We therefore believe that a military AI arms race would not be beneficial for humanity.\" \nIronically, contrary to its intention, the open letter may be an advertisement for  smart weapons for  just such purposes.  \nThe situation seems similar to the  1940s when scientists around the world warned that the  Nazis would soon have nuclear weapons and could use them to win the  war.\n  Those warnings from leading scientists, including Albert Einstein, arguably led to the global race for the first atomic bomb and all the nuclear weapons that still threaten to eradicate the human race today.\nAs ethical as the concerns of the scientists may be, they are coming too late and they are also quite naive. Reality has already taken over. \nIt is well known that some countries and companies are actively researching and massively investing in developing intelligent, autonomous battlefield robots, especially the US, Russian and Israeli militaries.  \nWe all know that   semi-autonomous drones used by the US military, such as the Predator and the Reaper, regularly strike targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \nThey are currently still remote-controlled by humans, however it's a relatively small step from there to make these drones fully autonomous.  \nIn the Gaza strip, semi-autonomous armed vehicles called Guardium are patrolling  Israel's border.  \nThe producer of the vehicle, G-NIUS, explains in its product brochure that the vehicle can act autonomously, detect \"suspicious activities\" and even react autonomously by using \"various methods of force\" to eliminate the threat. \nSome of the signatories, including   Musk and  Hawking, have previously compared the future threat of intelligent, autonomous robots  with  that posed by nuclear weapons, and have even predicted the end of the human race if their development  cannot be limited, regulated and controlled. \nHowever, in their open letter they have themselves already pointed to the key problem of any such efforts: \"Unlike nuclear weapons, they require no costly or hard-to-obtain raw materials, so they will become ubiquitous and cheap for all significant military powers to mass-produce.\" \nIn addition, autonomous drones and self-driving cars will soon be available as commercial products for anybody to purchase. \nThe chance to limit their use and the use of more sophisticated machines in military conflicts seems very low, even for optimists. \nThe biggest threat, however, may not be an arms race of nations like in the cold war, but rather that  a terrorist group may get  its hands on such easily accessible and affordable smart weapons, as the signatories have pointed out.\n Terrorists may soon have no need any more to use human suicide killers.

Wang Yuke reports.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) systems are designed to make people's lives easier by saving them a lot of boring work. But then have things move smoothly might come at the cost of giving up one's privacy. As Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) authorities plan to introduce its very own virtual assistant, security experts worry that such a move might backfire.\nZhang Kehuan, assistant professor of Information Engineering at Chinese University of Hong Kong, says introducing virtual assistants in HKIA could make the passengers using the facility more vulnerable to hackers.\n\"It's particularly true for HKIA, one of the world's busiest airports,\" said Zhang, whose research interests include security and privacy on the web, cloud, and distributed computing systems. Every individual walking into an airport comes with a huge personal data portfolio. This is valuable information that hackers are hungry to acquire, for commercial or illegal purposes, including bullying, says Zhang.\u00a0\nAI-powered virtual assistants \"get to know you\" with keen imaging and voice recognition. Some of them log every keystroke you enter into your device, says Zhang. Thus AI virtual assistants get to know one's clothing size, food preferences, favorite tourist destinations and even one's usual shopping budget. Virtual assistants also store more sensitive details, like credit card numbers, and other information which when leaked could allow criminals to steal one's identity. A virtual assistant requires access to people's personal information to be of any help. Once criminals hack into these systems, obtain a user's personal details including facial recognition and voice data, it's easy to steal the latter's identity, thus opening up a virtual Pandora's Box of online perils.\nVirtual assistants have been around for a while. Windows 10 introduced Cortana, and Apple's Siri has been around for several years. IBM's virtual assistant is called Watson. Amazon (Alexa) and Google (Home) are trying to catch up with their own systems. One might as well say in today's world, privacy is all but dead.\nAndy Bien, chief information officer at Airport Authority Hong Kong, acknowledges that several months ago HKIA's computer systems were hit by ransomware attacks. Unsuspecting users suddenly found their personal data encrypted and inaccessible until they agreed to pay a ransom to receive the key to unencrypt their data.\nHackers can steal a passenger's frequent flier miles and all the associated benefits such as free flights and seat upgrades. Holders of medical insurances are similarly vulnerable to having their medical benefits stolen. Identity thieves can hack social media accounts, pose as other people and try to extort money from the victims' friends.\nCyber crime is a great leveler. Anyone can become a victim. There's a new victim of cyber frauds every two seconds in the world, according to a study by Javelin Strategy and Research in 2014.\nA virtual assistant scans a user's calls, emails and text message histories to get an idea of his internet habits. When it spots a flight-related email in the user's inbox, it asks if the client wants to be kept posted on flight information. A virtual assistant in an airport is expected to keep updating a passenger on information related to his itinerary, on request, sparing him the trouble of checking emails every now and then. A passenger using the facility is told about the ideal time to leave home to avoid missing a flight; provided updates on the flight status, check-in status etc en route the airport. Besides, a user gets updates on the weather at the destination and is pointed towards bars, shops, restaurants and convenience stores as he waits to board the plane.\n\"We do find that travelers need a personal assistant on mobile devices to guide them through the chores and procedures before going aboard. The airport could be a foreign place to some, especially newcomers,\" said Bien. To do this, however, the AI systems behind the virtual helper need to parse through a lot of sensitive data, such as flight-related emails, voice calls and text messages relevant to one's trip. The virtual helper also wants to access a passenger's real-time location data and shopping history so that it can push alerts on discounts and offers in nearby stores to the user's mobile devices.\nAllowing third parties to access and use one's personal data for additional personalized services like these makes virtual assistant application users particularly vulnerable.\nConvenience vs privacy\nThe director of Business Development and Developer Experience at Microsoft Hong Kong, Joelle Woo, demonstrated how a virtual assistant might work in her Cyberport office. Shortly after sending a voice enquiry: \"Show me the next trip to Taiwan from Hong Kong\", the system responded with the details of the next available flight. \"How long does it take to reach HKIA from my office?\" received the answer \"32 minutes\". The time was calculated on the basis of current traffic data.\nThe system recognizes a customer's image and makes instant correlations between the individual's face and purchasing patterns. When a customer enters a shop at the airport, the salesperson is already aware of the former's preferences and can make specific recommendations based on these.\nBien says HKIA is still discussing which among the three alternatives - Cortana, Watson or Google's application - might be the best fit.\nComputers are getting smarter by the day as indeed are the hackers who steal personal information, said Zhang. They sneak into private or so-called \"dark\" networks, such as Tor, which enable users to access the internet anonymously. Their search histories, browsing habits and physical locations are difficult to track down. Taking advantage of the anonymity feature, online criminals can log into a dark network with their identities concealed and make illegal sales and transactions without their victims' knowledge.\nWoo said although Microsoft has done its fair share to minimize the odds of private data leakage, the possibility cannot be eliminated. Microsoft's disclaimer note says the company does not collect and store customer's data in its remote servers. \"But we can't rule out the chance that hackers lurking around would snatch your photos or other data during the time you are uploading them,\" explained Woo.\nKnow the risks involved\nThe airport needs to take responsibility for the service it's offering, cyber security experts agree. Ideally, the details of encryption standards followed as well as a list of those able to access the decrypted data should be explicitly stated and published. Also it's desirable that HKIA assigns a third party to conduct security auditing or penetrating testing, whereby the efficacy of the system is assessed by making it respond to simulated hacking and cyber attacks.\nBenjamin Wah, provost and professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Chinese University of Hong Kong, added that it's necessary to create random and unpredictable encryption keys used to unlock sensitive data so that hackers are unlikely to be able to decrypt users' data. He stressed that the airport needs to restrict decryption permission only to the airport system and to erase travelers' search histories and private information trails on a daily basis,\nBien said the encryption standard and data processing protocols of each supplier will weigh considerably in the final choice. While the airport carries out penetration tests at least once a year, and will continue to do so, introducing a new technology is usually a bit tricky, as it is likely to create \"a string of problems adding to the existing risk environment\", said Bien.\nProfessor Wah rules out guaranteed online security in a digitalized society, where individuals' data are stored in the cloud, even if the best of measures were taken to pre-empt unwanted access. After all, hardware and new applications evolve faster than countermeasures that engineers can conceive of.\nThe only thing we can do to protect ourselves from unwanted cyber attacks, says Wah, is to be better educated about the nature of the hazards one is risking by using AI-driven technology and know that such risks are ever present.\nBeing cautious would include deciding on the extent to which a user wants to share personal information with others. For example, if a passenger is using HKIA's virtual assistant service, he could opt out of sharing personal details with shops at the terminal. Then most users on the run tend to tick the \"agree\" boxes on these things, without a closer inspection, ignoring the choice to opt out of information sharing with third parties, says Wah.\n\"When there's an advanced technology or more intelligent software coming out, there will be better and more creative ways to hack it,\" says Woo. Even computer software giants, like Microsoft, have a tough time coping with the advent of novel viruses and hacking strategies. The solution is to \"educate our customers about data security and familiarize them with the latest cyber crimes\", says Woo.\nContact the writer at jenny@chinadailyhk.com\n(HK Edition 11\/29\/2016 page8)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/90\/148038057982.jpg\n00221917e13e19a6ec1101.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/95\/148038058209.jpg\n00221917e13e19a6ec1a02.jpg\n","726":"\u00a0\n Even today, some argue that the human mind is radically different from any other kind of intelligence - natural or artificial.\n For example, Push Singh, who runs an artificial\u00a0intelligence project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argues that the more we look at the human mind, the more intricacy we see. At this institute, they question whether science is anywhere near concocting a \"thinking machine\".\n I suspect that computers will outthink us one day, just as they already perform calculations and memorise information much better than we can.\u00a0\n Sure, they lack subtlety, but so what? Just look at the progress they have made in that game of strategy, intuition and cunning: chess. Way back in 1948, British mathematician Alan Turing developed a chess algorithm designed to challenge human opponents. The algorithm blew it, losing to an amateur player, and AI didn't seem like such a clever idea after all.\n But it was far from a case of game over. Duels pitting man against machine became a source of entertainment and the benchmark for determining how far AI had evolved.\n In the 1990s, IBM's Deep Blue went on to dazzle and defeat the grandmasters, showing that AI was advancing steadily.\n Now, computer programs routinely humble grandmasters. Unless you cripple the software, you probably cannot beat your computer or PDA at chess, or for that matter, checkers.\n Nonetheless, despite the hype generated by that flick in which Jude Law played silicon smoothie Gigolo Joe, AI has yet to establish itself as an integral part of our lives. The only AI that I regularly encounter scarcely merits the word \"intelligent\". The \"smart\" search engine I use just seems to churn out results in brute force style, with minimal insight into what my quarry might be.\n When I roam that AI wonderland, Second Life, sure the software enables me to badger, flirt with and rile other beings, human or otherwise. But it still feels worlds away from a time where AI is everywhere and so clever that it can pass the Turing test, convincingly posing as a fellow human for at least five minutes: simple conversational programs such as Eliza (www -ai.ijs.si\/eliza\/eliza.html) just do not cut it.\n Even so, the field has by no means fallen into a stupor. Quite the reverse, according to Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman in their exploration of progress titled Fantastic Voyage.\n Kurzweil and Grossman claim that science is advancing at a blistering pace. \"Because of this exponential growth, the 21st century will equal 20,000 years of progress at today's rate of progress,\" they said. And within 25 years, AI will match our mental prowess in scope and refinement, then leave us in the dust, struggling to make sense of what happened.\n Meanwhile, AI is starting to make waves where it is needed: the field of medicine.\n A computer system designed by a University of Sheffield team mimics a doctor's expertise in making treatment decisions for intensive-care patients. The system will give them just the right drug fix they need, shielding them against the threat of septic shock.\n Another AI medical miracle is the Rheo Knee, the sensors of which analyse the joint a thousand times a second, enabling it to adjust to any step or stumble.\n The Rheo's mindfulness allows amputees equipped with it to walk much more smoothly than with a standard low-tech peg.\n At New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, Penelope the nurse can \"see\", \"hear\" and even, through complex programming, \"reason\" - in other words, make choices.\n According to her maker, Michael Treat, Penelope is a colleague instead of a collection of electrical impulses: \"a stand-on-its-own kind of entity\".\n In Dr Treat's view, which echoes Kurzweil's, personal robots have now reached the spot where PCs hovered 20 years ago. We just need to give AI a couple of decades before it truly deserves to be ranked as intelligent.\n For now, let us indulge our lingering egomania and enjoy our status as the smartest entity on the planet while we can.\n","728":"A Chinese start-up is aiming to help the country's internet companies with one of their most pressing problems - pornographic, violent or other explicit content that finds its way onto their platforms and earns them slaps on the wrists from regulators.\u00a0\n\nTuputech, founded three years ago and based in Guangzhou, offers filtering of online images using deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\n\"By providing real-time image recognition for social media, live broadcasting and video and photo-sharing sites ... we can help companies to identify, tag and filter objectionable images - pornographic, violent or otherwise explicit or inappropriate,\" said Li Mingqiang, the founder of Tuputech and a former employee of internet giant Tencent Holdings.\n\n\"Our technology acts fast to detect inappropriate content and to help our clients remove it before it enters the online environment,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nLi said the company handled 900 million images a day and had reviewed more than 100 billion up to this month, and would be introducing its cloud-based image recognition solution to Chinese firms operating in the US market.\n\nThe company, which has attracted US$10 million in funding, is another example of the mainland's push into AI. In July, the government laid out goals to build a US$150 billion domestic AI industry in the next few years, and to make the country an \"innovation centre for AI\" by 2030.\n\n\"China has emerged as a major global contender in using AI to drive economic progress. Both the government and industry have identified AI and machine learning as the next big areas of innovation,\" said Goldman Sachs report.\n\n\"We expect further national policy and funding support on AI to follow.\"\n\nTuputech's clients include Inke, a live-streaming firm, and Meipai, a video streaming app, as well as Musical.ly, Live.me, China Mobile Communications, Thunder, China Unicom and Viva Video.\n\nWith high demand for information filtering globally, Li said Tuputech was profitable, but declined to disclose earnings.\n\nChinese authorities have clamped down on internet firms over explicit content, as part of a general crack down on cyberspace.\n\nLast month regulators imposed hefty fines on online giants Baidu and Tencent as well as on Weibo, the mainland's version of Twitter, for failing to adequately police their platforms and for allowing banned content, including pornographic material and content that incited ethnic hatred.\n\nThe authorities did not reveal the fine amounts, but under cybersecurity rules, the maximum fine could be up to 500,000 yuan (HK$586,600). Even then, the amount is minuscule compared with the multibillion-dollar revenues of each of the three technology giants.\n\nAs of May, the country's internet regulator now requires all online news broadcasters to obtain licences, and at the start of this year the government launched a 14-month nationwide campaign against unauthorised internet connections, including virtual private network (VPN) services, which allow users to bypass the country's \"Great Firewall\".\n","729":"AlphaGo, an artificial intelligence program, defeated China's top go player, 19-year-old Ke Jie, on Tuesday, the first day of five-day Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, East China's Zhejiang province.

When Ke confirmed via his social media micro blog account that he would take on AlphaGo at the May 23-27 go summit in Wuzhen, one of the best comments in the more than 4,600 \"likes\" was: \"Ke, you are facing mission impossible; we are proud of you!\"\nSome people are worried that if AlphaGo wins against another top-ranked go player, it would lend further credence to the belief that AI can be superior to the best human brains. They even fear that if AI continues to develop at this pace, it might rule over humans in the future.\nSuch fears seem exaggerated. The Google-developed neuronal network featuring \"deep learning algorithm\" has been used to build AlphaGo. Essentially, AlphaGo is an imitation of the human brain in terms of learning ability. And it imitates the human brain better than other AI devices.\nAlphaGo is almost unbeatable in go because of its fast computing ability, which allows it to review many moves and manuals within a very short time. But AIs are still incompetent when it comes to creative thinking.\nIn February 1996, the \"Deep Blue\" developed by IBM defeated then world chess champion Garry Kasparov. Since AlphaGo was developed about 20 years later and since go involves many more possibilities than chess, it is much more improved version of Deep Blue and has faster computing speed and more complicated algorithm.\nWhat should truly arouse our concern is the competition in AI technology among different countries. As a highly advanced technological product, AI is a key index of a country's technological development. On April 1, iimedia.cn, a domestic technological website, released its 2017 China Artificial Intelligence Industry Report, which said the country's AI industry grew by 43.3 percent to 10.06 billion yuan ($1.46 billion) last year. This year the growth rate is estimated to be as high as 51.2 percent.\nIn late February, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced the \"10 Breakthrough Technologies 2017\" in its Technology Review, which included reinforcement learning, self-driving cars as well as paying with your face. Several domestic companies, such as iFly Tek, Alibaba and Baidu, have been conducting research in these areas. Also, the State Intellectual Property Office received 29,023 applications for patents related to AI technology last year.\nThat means China is doing well in AI research. But the problem is that only a few of the research results have been put into practical use. In the United States, universities, research institutions and enterprises have formed a \"positive circle\" to work with each other to turn creative ideas into innovative technologies to ultimately create revolutionary products.\nChina has many talented and hard-working researchers. It also has excellent entrepreneurs who strive to make breakthroughs in different fields. The need therefore is to link the two so that path-breaking research can be used to make innovative products.\nThe author is a writer with China Daily.\nzhangzhouxiang@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 05\/24\/2017 page10)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/80\/149561569246.jpg\neca86bda350e1a8f13da42.jpg\n","730":"Renowned Go player Lee Se-dol lost his five-game match with Google's AlphaGo computer program on Tuesday in Seoul, raising concerns about the formidable capability of artificial intelligence.\u00a0\nThe best human Go player won only a single game against the program, which is powered by about 2,000 central processing units and 170 graphic processing units - generating a computing capability far superior to the human brain.\nHowever, such hardware will soon be a thing of the past.\nHanwuji neural network chips are designed for better learning ability than general-purpose chips. Provided to China Daily\nChinese scientists have developed a neural network chip that is likely to pack AlphaGo's computing clusters into the size of a personal computer.\n\"Computers are doing much better than humans in terms of memorizing and calculating. However, their performance on solving some intelligence problems that require understanding, learning and reasoning is unsatisfactory,\" said Chen Yunji, a professor of the Institute of Computing Technology affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences who is a co-inventor of the chip.\nIn 2010, Chen and his younger brother Chen Tianshi, who also works for the institute, began to explore a new type of computer processor dedicated to machine learning.\nThe difference between a common chip - the CPU and GPU on personal computers - and a neural network chip is like the difference between a Swiss Army knife and a large chef's knife, Chen Tianshi said.\n\"The common chip on our computers can operate all different kinds of procedures, just like the Swiss Army knife has a variety of blades. But if you use a Swiss Army knife to cut meat, it will be much harder than using a special tool like the chef's knife,\" he said.\nSimilarly, it has been extremely difficult to run deep-learning algorithms, an essential artificial intelligence technology, with common chips.\nThe Chen brothers' neural network chip, called Hanwuji, is designed for better learning ability than general-purpose chips. By late 2014, both generations of the chip won ASPLOS Best Paper Awards, one of highest international awards in the computer research field.\nThe Chens are establishing a company in Beijing to mass-produce the chips.\nchengyingqi@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 03\/16\/2016 page3)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/99\/145809755580.jpg\nf04da2db11221852ea7d1c.jpg\n","731":"Jinri Toutiao, a leading news aggregator app, has trained sights on the BRICS economies to extend its artificial\u00a0intelligence-backed business as more people embrace mobile gadgets to receive information and consume content.\u00a0\nJinri Toutiao, a leading news aggregator app, has trained sights on the BRICS economies to extend its artificial\u00a0intelligence-backed business as more people embrace mobile gadgets to receive information and consume content, a company executive said.\nRussia is probably the next destination for Toutiao to branch out overseas, after it reaped initial successes in India and Brazil, said Liu Zhen, senior vice-president of its parent company Beijing Bytedance Technology Co Ltd.\nLiu Zhen, senior vice-president of Beijing Bytedance Technology Co Ltd. [Photo provided to China Daily]\n\"We are set to benefit from the ongoing wave of smartphone penetration and growth of the internet infrastructure in these countries,\" Liu said. \"We can expand via acquisitions or by building up our own products.\"\nThe app, which translates into \"Today's Headlines\", uses algorithms to scour a massive number of sources to filter news and tailor feeds. It comes as traditional news portals lose their luster in the mobile age and traditional media fails to attract news-hungry users who want to stay up-to-date and relevant.\nLast year the five-year-old startup bought a stake in Indian news aggregator Dailyhunt, and introduced the local version of TopBuzz, the company's English-language news service, in Brazil.\nIn terms of which path it will take in Russia, Liu said it really depends on whether it can find the right local partner, the one thing to factor in for cross-cultural communication businesses.\nToutiao is also active in reaching out to mature markets, buying US video app Flipagram in February. The case was overseen by Liu, a veteran lawyer and Uber Technologies Inc's former China strategy chief before joining Toutiao's senior management late last year.\nAside from emerging markets, \"Japan, South Korea, Western Europe and most of the English-speaking countries are on the top priority of our expansive roadmap,\" she said.\nToutiao is the most frequently downloaded news product in China's iOS App Store, according to market research firm App Annie. The service has garnered 120 million daily active users, who spend an average of around 70 minutes a day on Toutiao.\nOne major challenge is to identify and customize products that resonate with local people's interests. For instance, Indian audiences are mostly drawn by music, dance and cricket-related feeds, which is a far cry from the preferences of Toutiao's domestic users, Liu noted.\nAnd because Toutiao doesn't have its own staff writers, finding the initial group of curators becomes critical to building enough sets of the data it relies on to expand its user base.\nThe app aggregates content not just from traditional news outlets, but also video, live streaming, social media and a growing army of individual contributors, which form the backbone of its $11 billion business, according to estimates from CB Insights.\nLiu said with the advent of machine learning, AI can broaden people's horizons by recommending topics of potential interest that go beyond their conventional reading scope.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/86\/150465999720.jpg\nb083fe955aa11b1972d108.jpg\n","732":"About 2.3 million finance industry employees in mainland China are likely to either lose their jobs, or be reassigned to new roles, by 2027, as they fall victim to disruptive artificial intelligence technologies.\u00a0\nA study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that 23 per cent of the total 9.93 million jobs in the country's banking, insurance and securities sectors will be affected, with entry-level staff engaged in repetitious daily operations bearing the brunt of any cuts.\n\"Many jobs, particularly those involving mechanical, repetitious operations, will gradually be replaced by AI,\" David He, a BCG partner, said in a statement. \"Consequently, some positions will be cancelled, but other positions will see improvements in efficiency, and new jobs will be created.\"\nThe study is based on interviews with highly skilled professionals in the finance and AI industries, and the use of analytical tools, the global consultancy said.\nIts findings come at a time when nearly all mainland banks are embracing the latest digital technologies to save human resource costs and enhance security and convenience. Facial recognition and big data technologies are increasingly being used in either automatic teller machines, or by credit assessment departments.\nThe industry also faces stiff competition from a booming financial technology sector.\nA \"robo-adviser\" service has also been launched, which uses computer programs to dish out investment advice for retail clients over mobile banking platforms.\n\"All banks have been aware of the importance of digitalising businesses,\" said Wan Hua, a senior HR official with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. \"Banks are testing new business operating models at select outlets, with reductions in human power and installations of new technologies.\"\nChina's leadership, wary of the country's low manufacturing efficiency, thinks it has found a solution - digitalisation.\nGlobal management consultancy McKinsey said in a report at the end of 2017 that digital services will help restructure value chains in China with more dynamic companies emerging and, hence, strengthen the global competitiveness of its economy.\nIn the finance sector, facial recognition enables ATMs to dispense cash by scanning customers' faces, and some banks use bots at their outlets to run automated tasks over the internet to communicate and serve clients at speeds several times faster than humans can.\nNot surprisingly, there are mounting worries among finance industry employees that their job security will be threatened by a wider use of digital technologies. Moreover, Chinese state-owned institutions and companies have long been criticised for staggering payrolls with thousands of employees sitting idle during office hours.\nICBC launches robo-adviser service for wealth-management products\nBCG, however, also said the severity of the impact by AI on China's financial industries should not be overestimated.

China Daily reporters interviewed a group of senior information technology business executives to learn their views about innovation and how internet is reshaping China.\nQ1: What do you think of the role of the internet or innovations in China's economic transformation?\nQ2: From your perspective, what are the characteristics of a powerful internet country? What do you think are the advantages and challenges China face in becoming a powerful internet country?\nQ3: In the next few years, which sector do you think will most likely become a disruptor in the internet or technology space? Or in other words, what do you think will be the next hotspot or trend?\u00a0\nQ4: In terms of a \"capital winter\", what kind of impact do you see it having on your company, and how would you forecast the \"temperature\" in the internet market in 2017?\nQ5: In the past year, what transformations in the internet or technology sector do you think have the ability to influence our future or the future of the industry? What do you think are the reasons for this transformation?\nFrank Meng, chairman of Qualcomm China\nA1 Today, China is building itself into a new innovation powerhouse. Innovation will be prioritized in China's development in the next five years to shift China's economic structure into a higher-quality and sustainable growth model.\nA2 China has played an essential role in the development of the mobile internet. Enhancing China's innovation capabilities will be a key driver for China to evolve into an internet powerhouse, and the key is to proactively deploy in and integrate itself into the global innovation network and optimize the allocation of innovation resources worldwide in the future.\nA3 Connectivity is widely used in the healthcare, education, automotive, robotics and drone sectors, and has yielded substantial results. Take the automotive industry as an example. We believe that regardless of what the next promising area is, the core will certainly be the capability of leveraging connectivity and mobile computing technologies to change people's lives and become a tool of productivity.\nA4 In the area of venture capital investment, we are at the top as the most active corporate VC worldwide in the mobile and telecommunication fields. And today, we are strategically shifting our investment focus from \"mobile internet\" to \"frontier technology\", which includes artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality and aerospace technology.\nA5 5G is a unifying, more capable communications fabric that will take on a much bigger role than previous generations of mobile technology. It's a layer of connectivity that will become fundamental to our cities, jobs, homes, and ourselves. 5G will expand mobile networks and technologies into a much wider range of industries and thus change the way we interact with our world and each other.\nLi Dongsheng, chairman and CEO of TCL Corp\nA1 The development and innovation of the internet plays a crucial role in the transformation of China's economy and they are the driving force for the transformation and upgrading of modern enterprises. Under such a background, higher standards are set for China's enterprises. They should progressively upgrade products that are \"Made in China\".\nA2 A world-leading internet power should be based on the support of national policies, and speed up the self-innovation of network information technology. China has a strong internet infrastructure and wide application of Internet, and a huge number of netizens. Meanwhile, related policies released by the government also foster the building of a leading internet power. However, we still need to do more in innovation in technology, business models and cybersecurity.\nA3 The global economy has entered a new phase from depending on efficiency, speed and cost to technological innovation and upgrading of management concepts and business models. The building of an ecological internet system which integrates intelligent application and service into the real life should be the trend of the future.\nA4 Against the background of rapid changes in global industry and markets, TCL has attached great importance to the building of core capacities, especially the enhancement of product technological innovation and global brand competitiveness. TCL has also been investing greatly in technological R&D and expanding the international market.\nA5 The convenience, technology and reciprocity of the internet will complement the advantages of manufacturing industry and the Internet. And the development of the internet provides new business opportunities to manufacturers.\nElaine Chang, vice-president of Amazon and president of Amazon China\nA1 The beauty of the internet is that it connects the whole world, creating a global platform, allowing us to drive innovation not only for China, but also globally.\nA2 China has the world's largest base of internet users, and is already an internet leader in many ways. China is also able to take advantage of having a minimal technology legacy and leap frog into new technologies, mobile payments, on demand transportation, and social networks. With customers who are willing to adapt to innovation quickly, the challenge will be to strike the right balance between time to market and high quality. The strong competitive environment also poses another challenge for new companies and technologies to grow fast sustainably.\nA3 The internet is so ubiquitous and there are increasing ways to better target and serve customers all the time. For Retail, Amazon believes that customers will always care about three things: Selection, Pricing, Convenience, and we design our customer experience to optimize this specifically.\nA4 Globally, the internet industry is still growing, and the bar for investment may be higher, however, if you can serve customers well the opportunity is still there. For Amazon China, I believe e-commerce will continue to be a dynamic industry growing rapidly in 2017, especially in cross-border e-commerce. Chinese customers have shown tremendous enthusiasm toward cross-border online shopping.\nA5 Drones and artificial intelligence have experienced fast developments in the past year and could very possibly become the next revolutionary wave for the e-commerce industry. Voice as a computing interface is also a key trend.\nYang Yuanqing, chairman and CEO of Lenovo Group Ltd\nA1 In the future, the internet industry and traditional sectors will be more deeply intertwined. New businesses will emerge and help expedite innovation and progress in technology and overall economic growth. Chinese enterprises should seize this great opportunity to restructure business.\nA2 Only when we equip ourselves with innovative technologies, products and business models, can we say we are helping China become a leading internet power. Strong government support is one of China's edges. Besides, we have the world's largest internet population and a thriving internet industry.\nA3 Artificial intelligence will be the next big thing. Because of AI, the mobile internet is about to take a further leap to become the smart internet. Consumer electronic products will also become smarter because big data will empower them with self-learning ability. Driven by the joint force of AI and the internet, hard-ware manufacturers and solution providers will become increasingly intertwined and evolve into service providers that thrive on the business model of Devices plus Cloud plus Service.\nA4 Opportunities still abound in China. It is still a gold mine and we can always create new market demand and new opportunities, even by reorganizing the existing resources. It is true that as investments cool down, companies are facing challenges, but we should speed up efforts to train our wings. Full-fledged enterprises can survive unforgiving environment and they know how to predict the market trend and adjust their businesses accordingly.\nA5 We have seen major breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence. It is getting out of laboratories and the professional community. It is becoming a topic for everyone. The historic victory by AlphaGo over the human world champion of the ancient strategy game Go showcased the huge potential of AI. Major firms are all scrambling to establish a beachhead in the industry. AI will revolutionize the internet sector.\nChen Liming, chairman of IBM Greater China Group\nA1 China's economic transformation is like a rebirth of internal strength. It aims to thoroughly remould itself. Currently, the macroeconomy sustains a steady growth. On the micro level, however, China is experiencing fast changes. Internet innovation is the emerging force that plays a catalytic and supporting role in reshaping China's economy.\nA2 China's advantage lies in its huge internet population and its industry scale. But the internet sector is highly globalized. Measuring industry scale by country is a mindset of the industrial age and may not be a good benchmark in the internet era. Only by cultivating bigger global influence can Chinese firms help push the country's internet industry to a new height.\nA3 \"Disruption\" is not an appropriate word to describe the interaction between new technology and traditional industries. The two are, in fact, contributing to each other's development. When looking forward to the next big thing, it's better to look to new technology such as artificial intelligence, block chain and virtual reality. Personally, I pay more attention to AI and cognitive science. Based on IBM's experience in more than 20 industries including healthcare, environmental protection, finance and manufacturing, we believe cognitive technology, represented by IBM's Watson, can greatly enhance individuals and organizations' competence, promote the development of each industry and help improve every one's life quality.\nA4 I won't comment or predict the \"temperature\" of the capital market. But it is worth pointing out that the IT industry is currently driven by active technological innovation and boasts huge opportunities. Hard work, rather than hype, is needed to make the most of these opportunities. Be optimistic and down-to-earth. That's what we need.\nA5 We have seen many technological breakthroughs in the past year in sectors such as cognitive science and block chain technologies. But I want to highlight a breakthrough in basic science. In August, IBM found a way to put a single bit of data on a 12-atom surface, creating the world's smallest magnetic storage device and boosting the current storage density by nearly 100,000 times. Before that, it required 1 million atoms for such storage. If the technology is put into use, we could store 30,000 full-length HD movies in one cell phone. And this would definitely have a revolutionary influence on the future digital life of human beings.\nHarry Shum, executive vice-president of Microsoft\nA1 The shift in China's economy toward an innovation-led development model will create huge demand for internet-connected technologies that help companies transform their operations and improve efficiency. These technologies enable new business models and new drivers of economic growth. The Internet of Things will play a vital role in the digital transformation of China's manufacturing industries.\nA2 China has firmly established itself as a center for innovation and global internet leadership, especially in the mobile internet space. China's internet industry enjoys especially strong support from a policy perspective, as the government is actively promoting digital transformation across a wide range of industries while at the same time working to establish a market environment that rewards innovation and entrepreneurship. In terms of challenges, China must continue to invest in programs and implement policies that encourage innovation, such as the improvement of IP protection.\nA3 Increasingly intelligent technologies will help accelerate the process of digital transformation that is already underway across a wide spectrum of industries. In the future, I believe every company will be, in many ways, an internet company. The integration of internet technologies and industry has the potential to provide China with a huge economic boost, especially in the manufacturing sector which has been one of the primary beneficiaries of advances in IoT technology and data intelligence.\nA4 Startup companies bring innovative new ideas to the IT industry, so it's important that they have the necessary capital and technology resources to grow and reach their true potential. Despite the global economic slowdown, at Microsoft we are continuing to invest in empowering startups. In China, we have been running the Microsoft Accelerator program for four years, which provides qualifying top startups with four to six months of Acceleration and GTM resources. I expect this innovation and entrepreneurship enthusiasm will continue going forward in 2017.\nA5 One area we have seen major breakthroughs in the past year is artificial intelligence. Advancements in voice and image recognition technologies has given rise to a new application platform that consist of digital assistants, chatbots, and conversation. With a new app model that's so powerful that it can unleash the full potential of mobile and cloud.\nDerek Shen, global vice-president and China president of LinkedIn\nA1 China is currently undergoing a shift in perception, from \"made in China\" to \"created in China\", from \"population boon\" to \"talent boon\". Whereas before, the emphasis was on productivity, the emphasis now is on innovation and entrepreneurship.\nA2 A pertinent analogy is that the internet landscape is comprised of two poles, China and the United States. Both the US and China have huge local markets, abundant venture capital resources, large technology talent pools and great entrepreneurial cultures. China is quite adept at business model innovation while US companies strive to pursue pushing the boundaries of technology.\nA3 I believe that AI will become the next transformative trend. That is, artificial intelligence will become one of the high-tech that will lead us into the next decade or beyond.\nA4 But before \"capital winters\" there will be a \"capital summer\", which means that there will be a time where there is too much capital in the market. This also means that there were a lot of great seeds planted, seeds of innovation and entrepreneurship. From an entrepreneurial standpoint, this \"capital winter\" can be a good thing, because before we can reap what has been sown, the fittest must have survived the winter. Those that survive will have a solid model, a strong team, and the financial capability to support its model. The \"temperature\" of the internet in 2017 will, in fact, follow a natural course. Spring will inevitably follow winter.\nA5 We've seen in the past year, there has been a rising new concept, which is artificial intelligence. We predict that AI will lead the future of our technological developments, and the era of artificial intelligence will extend for a very long period of time. In the future, every aspect of our daily lives can be influenced or affected by artificial intelligence and the transformation it will bring to our lives.\nEric Jing, CEO of Ant Financial Services Group\nA1 New technologies are driving the innovation of all industries in China. And innovation in turn drives the growth of China's economy amid its transition from being investment-reliant to consumption-driven.\nA2 China owns the world-leading mobile payment technology. This reflects how much we've grown with self-dependent innovation. Besides the development of technology, the various application scenarios are another advantage we have to become an \"internet power\". America is still leading scientific innovation trends, building technological barriers that are difficult for Chinese companies to break down. So the companies must gain an international perspective and work harder, and the government and society also need to help create a more tolerant and friendly environment for companies to innovate in.\nA3 The next \"whirlwind\" will emerge in the application field of technologies, instead of the technologies themselves. As more constantly being applied, the innovative technologies will deeply integrate with other industries, finance included, generating opportunities for both internet companies and traditional industries to grow.\nA4 The \"investment woes\" are actually a result of the \"law of the jungle\" in the market area. Some startups divert too much energy making up good stories to the investors rather than properly managing risks. They will be abandoned by the market eventually. Instead, the \"fittest ones\" that can survive are companies with a clear value proposition - they are client-oriented, and can keep a continuous growth path.\nA5 I personally favor the possibilities that artificial intelligence can bring to our world. We have widely adopted technology in our businesses like security control, credit risk management, insurance pricing and customer service.\nSun Jie, chief operating officer of Ctrip\nA1 Innovation can give an impetus to China's economic transition. Particularly, innovation in the internet industry has brought profound changes to the Chinese economy and its consumers. It has been proven in Ctrip.\nA2 Internet power is in fact a power of technology and innovation. I think there is a key component of measuring internet power, that is whether it can provide better services to its consumers and meet their needs. So when China aspires to be an internet superpower, it is necessary to improve the service capabilities of internet companies. China is a large nation of great population, which creates a huge market scale and potential and a large talent pool for the growth of internet industry. These are important foundation for China moving toward an internet power.\nA3 Every industry can be influenced by innovation and new technology. In the short term, we have been witnessing the explosive growth of mobile internet. Similarly, we will possibly see the expansion of artificial intelligence, upgrading robots, VR\/AR and so forth. But eventually whether they will become the hotspot or not will be tested by time and market.\nA4 The \"capital winter\" happens to be a great investment opportunity for excellent companies like Ctrip. We can tell that from our performance on the Nasdaq and from our yearly financial report. No matter what, Crtip is looking a warm market in 2017. As more and more Chinese people are traveling abroad, we still expect growth in the online travel market.\nA5 Virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics turn out surprising. Those technologies will change the environment of the whole industry for the benefit of online travel agents. More importantly, they can create a better booking experience for customers when lowering down the booking fees.\nShen Ya, CEO of Vip.com\nA1 The internet has reshaped the Chinese economy in two ways: it stimulates the overall growth of the innovation business as a strategically new industry; it propels the transformation and upgrading of traditional industry as an innovative technology. The internet makes information-based services accessible to the public, in turn making mass entrepreneurship and innovation possible.\nA2 China is an internet behemoth and will be an internet superpower in the future. To realize the transition, we need to integrate the newest technology with other social and economic components. China has the world's largest internet user volume and internet-friendly policy. This is a great advantage over other nations. But the transition can be painful, especially when it comes to the transformation of traditional industries.\nA3 Internet companies with tremendous data will become a rich resource in the future. We will use that data to improve personalized marketing and create a flexible supply chain based on sales prospects, in favor of the supply-side reform strategy.\nA4 The internet is less active or dynamic this year, compared with how it was in the past two years when the whole industry was booming. The capital market's cool down, however, can speed up a reshuffle of this industry and help eliminate the less qualified players, to let the companies with real innovations emerge.\nA5 Online-to-offline platforms are merging, live video streaming and cyber celebrity economy are booming, e-commerce platforms and social websites are integrating. Meanwhile, the \"individual power\" has been fully cultivated and highly valued, and can even become influential intellectual property. The once comprehensive and platform-type internet is becoming personalized and specialized.\nZhao Weiguo, chairman of Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd\nA1 The internet itself is a result of innovation, and innovation is the engine that drives China's economic transformation. In return, the internet industry will also definitely speed up innovations in our country.\nA2 Leading \"internet powers\" feature ubiquitous networks, connectivity and big data. China has a well-developed internet infrastructure and a vast amount of netizens, which can help it grow into a leading internet power. But it is also facing challenges. China lacks core technologies to outcompete others. We excel in applying the internet to solve problems and we are good at coming up with innovative business models, but we are weak in research and development of core technologies.\nA3 Obviously, the finance industry is most likely to be reshaped by the internet and big data technology, so I believe internet finance will be the next big opportunity. To some extent, in fact, it is already booming. Virtual reality and argumented reality are also the next gold mine.\nA4 The so called \"winter\" of the capital market in 2016 is the result of bursting bubbles in the industry. But it has no impact on Tsinghua Unigroup's business. Next year, I believe investors will be even more calm and soberminded.\nA5 In 2016, VR and AR industries are emerging rapidly. I think this trend will have far-reaching and long-lasting influence on our future life.\nYan Haifeng, president of Tuniu\nA1 The internet has become the \"new engine\" to drive China's economic reform, as it encouraged innovations in technology, services and enterprises, generating far-reaching impact on the transition and upgrade of Chinese economy and society.\nA2 China now has the biggest netizen population in the world, with the network infrastructure, internet companies, internet culture and cyber law-enforcement booming. However, some challenges still exist. First, we have to make an extra effort in law-enforcement in cyber space and perfect the management system. Then we will attract more talents and own the core technology and essential resources. Still, we must enhance international cooperation, benefiting the whole world with joint power.\nA3 The next big challenges for internet companies will be in the service sector, expansion of the global market, and building a service ecosystem on a global scale.\nA4 The internet industry is facing an unprecedented opportunity thanks to the Chinese government's \"Internet Plus\" strategy. Facing the cooling down trend of investment, internet startups should concentrate more on innovation both in business model and technology to maintain sustainable development. They should put great value on users' needs and interests and build a good industry image to attract investment again.\nA5 The growth of the mobile internet. Let's take Tuniu as an example. Its second-quarter results show Tuniu's app has been downloaded over 700 million times, 120 million more times than the first quarter. Registered users can use the app via tablet and smartphone to choose group tours, DIY travel, cruises, as well as book flights, train tickets, hotels, obtain visas and so on.\nXiao Hong, CEO of Perfect World Co Ltd\nA1 To a certain extent, internet or innovation can serve as the new engine for China's economic transition and upgrading, the core of which lies on the improvement of resources allocation and efficiency enhancement. The advocated Internet Plus, more precisely speaking, is \"internet plus change\", meaning rebirth for certain industries.\nA2 Whether a country is an internet power is basically determined by its overall national strength. Enjoying the advantages of the world's largest internet users and several world's top 10 internet companies, China is on its path to becoming an internet power. Some challenges, however, are plaguing China. Many internet companies lack innovation, resulting in the emergence of plagiarism, imitation or even vicious competition.\nA3 In next few years, the gaming industry may be completely subverted due to the rapid development of virtual technology. Thanks to the maturity of artificial intelligence and prevalence of the Internet of Things, more intelligent unmanned vehicles emerge and it is likely to have a leap-style development. Artificial intelligence is undoubtedly a field in the eye of future technology.\nA4 The so-called \"capital winter\" is a more rational and prudent change in the capital market. Investors are no longer blind as the past, but more mature to pay attention to specific projects. However, typically reflected as a lack of innovation, our internet market is still not sufficiently impetuous to win the favor of capital, resulting in an ostensible capital winter. The \"capital winter\" tends to be a turning point for startups, as it teach them a lesson on how to gain access to better resources at a low cost, so that we may usher in a warm 2017.\nA5 Artificial intelligence is undoubtedly the biggest surprise brought by new technology. Now, not only the AlphaGo and artificial intelligence research by Microsoft and Facebook are fruitful, but also China has made great progress in recent years. Moreover, AI tends to be applied in a vast range of fields, including the internet, medicine, manufacture and so on.\n(China Daily 11\/16\/2016 page18)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/81\/147927556162.jpg\n00221917e13e1995ed8a26.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/45\/147927556249.jpg\n00221917e13e1995edab27.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/80\/147927556449.jpg\n00221917e13e1995edb428.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/18\/147927556535.jpg\n00221917e13e1995edc829.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/32\/147927556622.jpg\n00221917e13e1995eddc2a.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/2\/147927556823.jpg\n00221917e13e1995edf22b.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/70\/147927557210.jpg\n00221917e13e1995ee042c.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/43\/147927557413.jpg\n00221917e13e1995ee172d.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/32\/147927558116.jpg\n00221917e13e1995ee2e2e.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/6\/147927558209.jpg\n00221917e13e1995ee3e2f.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/38\/147927558399.jpg\n00221917e13e1995ee5330.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/12\/147927558492.jpg\n00221917e13e1995ee6031.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/91\/147927558596.jpg\n00221917e13e1995ee7532.jpg\n","735":"In the mainland, where many parents still believe that going to a good university is a sure bet for a successful life, little expense or effort is spared to prepare their children for the annual university entrance examination.\n\nKnown as gaokao in Chinese, the examination takes place over a few days each June, testing students on subjects that include Chinese, mathematics, the sciences and a foreign language.\n\u00a0\nThe combined score, similar to the grade point average in the United States, is then used to rank and channel students into different universities. Top institutes such as Tsinghua University and Peking University, like Harvard and Yale, get the ones with the highest scores.\n\nBut what if students could get the help of robot teachers to help them prepare for the examination? Machine tutors that know the students \"much better than they understand themselves\", in the words of Yixue Education co-founder Li Haoyang.\n\nIn a contest between Yixue's artificial-intelligence-backed software and tutors with an average teaching experience of 17 years, the machines were able to improve test scores more than their human counterparts.\n\nThe contest, which involved 78 students, took place in October in Zhengzhou, Henan province, under the supervision of the education bureau and was monitored by analysis firm iResearch.\n\n\"Traditional teaching in the classroom is very low in efficiency as the weaknesses of each student varies,\" Li said. \"Many students waste time learning knowledge that they have mastered repeatedly, as the teachers want to take care of those who have yet to know it well. But even then, slower learners could still be left behind as teachers may not be able to spend enough time to help them.\"\n\nYixue's learning methods use artificial intelligence to identify a student's weaknesses, then the tutoring is tailored to reinforce those areas, according to Li, one of four co-founders of Shanghai-based Yixue.\n\nFor now, the software is geared towards students from primary to secondary, and the company plans to introduce courses for students taking the gaokao next year.\n\nYixue is competing with other start-ups such as Hujiang EdTech for a slice of an expanding pie in the online education industry, which iResearch projects will increase more than 70 per cent from last year to 269.26 billion yuan (HK$318.5 billion) in revenue in 2019.\n\nOther educational start-ups include Liulishuo, which uses artificial-intelligence-powered software to teach users English.\n\nAfter four days of intensive training, students using Yixue's software saw their average mathematics test scores increase 36.13 points, compared with 26.18 for those tutored by teachers, according to the company.\n\nHenan is the most competitive province for a college position in the country. This year, more than 860,000 students took the gaokao in the province, but only 10 per cent of them - the lowest percentage in the country - were able to go to \"key universities\" that are regarded as well-known and receive a high level of government support.\n\nFor Yixue, which raised 270 million yuan in a funding round this year, the next step is to expand to Hong Kong and Taiwan, followed by Southeast Asia and eventually to Europe and the US, according to Li. The software was adaptable to students worldwide regardless of language, he said.\n\nThe company has more than 100,000 paid users, with about 10,000 spending more than 10,000 yuan each on the platform, according to Li.\n\nSome students spend as much as 50,000 yuan as they take multiple courses. Gross profit margin is about 80 to 90 per cent, although that may change as Yixue explores plans to open 2,000 training centres to serve parents who are still accustomed to sending their children to a classroom.\n\nYixue was also recently in discussions with Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics, which is behind the Sophia humanoid robot, to create human-looking droids to interact with students in a classroom setting, Li said.\n\n\"The children really have it very tough,\" he said. \"By building this system, I hope to be able to free them.\"\n","736":" Get set to strap up those boots, tighten that buckle, grab your helmet and return to battle in Activision's Call of Duty 2, the sequel to 2003's best-selling personal computer action game developed by Infinity Ward.\u00a0\n The original Call of Duty set a benchmark for portraying the chaos and intensity of war with lifelike authenticity in a video game.\n There is more explosive action with bigger battles in the sequel, more destructive weapons and troops, more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and amazing special effects set in a wide range of locations and environments.\n Gamers will soon be immersed in armed battle through the eyes of soldiers fighting together in epic second world war conflicts.\n Call of Duty 2 is set across three Allied campaigns: Russian, British and American. Gamers can play through each storyline to its completion, or choose to engage the enemy in historic battles chronologically from 1941 through 1945.\n Although players are free to take on mission objectives in any order, they must use actual combat tactics such as outflanking and fire and manoeuvre to succeed.\n Each campaign is split into missions. Each mission offers plenty of opportunities for players to approach their objectives, such as clearing bunkers, running in and out of ruined houses, taking out emplacements, crawling through trenches, planting explosives on moving tanks and killing Nazis.\n Each mission is further split into sections. As the players complete each mission, more are unlocked.\n Players can fight as a British officer against Rommel across the deserts of North Africa. They can play an American corporal joining an Army Ranger squad that uses rocket-propelled grappling hooks to storm the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc. They can also slog through the urban chaos of Stalingrad and Moscow in blizzard conditions as a tank hunter.\n Most impressive is the groundbreaking AI used in Call of Duty 2. Dozens of Allied soldiers surrounding a player are fully aware of the changing situations around them, and will let a player know using an all-new, context-sensitive battle chatter system. They will draw enemy fire, use foxholes and moving tanks for cover, and warn you of incoming troops and hostile fire.\n Call of Duty 2\n Specifications\n Price: $270 for the CD version and $300 for the DVD\n Pros: Greater variety of campaigns and game play design. A smarter enemy and team members make for the most stunning second world war shooter game yet\n Cons: Use of smoke grenades and other graphic-intensive weapons and tactics during game play would be too much for a regular PC to handle\n","739":"Unlike search-engine rival Google's vehicle, it will still require a human\nChinese search engine leader Baidu Inc, widely known as the Google of China, is following in the Western Internet giant's footsteps by working on its own version of a self-driving car.\nThe Beijing-based company confirmed it has already initiated the project. But compared with Google's innovation, which requires no driver at all, Baidu's car will be \"highly autonomous\", serving mainly as an aid to drivers.\u00a0\nYu Kai, deputy director of Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning, said in a recent interview that Baidu's car is \"semi-self-driving\". Compared with Google's prototype, which has no steering wheel or pedals, Baidu's car is more like a \"horse\" that would guide itself unless the driver wanted to take over.\nAccording to Yu, the car under development will be equipped with radar, camera and sensors, as well as a navigation system. The car can automatically drive itself as soon as a destination is entered into the navigation system. The sensors will upload traffic conditions, and using big data technology, the car will make its own decisions about such things as direction and driving speed. A prototype is expected next year.\nThe aim of the project is to improve driving safety through the help of big data and artificial intelligence, Yu said.\nXin Haiguang, an independent Chinese Internet expert, said that the project is in line with Baidu's strengths in big data and human-computer interaction.\n\"Baidu is a search company. It has strong advantages in gathering and processing data. Search engines basically offer answers to people after data analysis. The car is practically doing the same thing by making driving decisions after analyzing traffic conditions.\"\nThe development of a self-driving car is not the first project Baidu has copied from Google. Media reports last year showed it also is working on a project called Baidu Eye, which is similar to Google Glass. In March, Baidu hired Andrew Ng, founder of the \"Google Brain,\" to run its artificial intelligence labs.\n\"Companies like Baidu, Google and Facebook all generate revenue through advertising. Therefore, it is natural for Baidu to be pursuing a similar strategy to Google's, because the more information you have about people, the more that you can earn in advertising revenue from them,\" said Neil Flynn, head equity analyst at Shanghai-based Chineseinvestors.com, a leading financial analysis firm of US-listed Chinese companies.\n\"If you had a self-driving car, Google would, for example, recognize that you tend to go to a pizza restaurant every Tuesday at 7 pm, and could therefore advertise local pizzerias to you every Tuesday at 6:30 pm. By having products that users can use in every aspect of their lives, Google can understand each of its users in depth and develop an optimal advertising strategy for each individual,\" he said.\nGoogle has greatly diversified businesses, from self-driving cars to home appliances and Android mobile operating systems.\n\"As diverse as these are, they will all be fundamentally used by Google to collect data about its users,\" Flynn said.\nBaidu seems to be moving in a similar direction, fueled by heavy investment in research and development. Its recently released second quarter financial report showed that its R & D expenditure surged nearly 85 percent year-on-year to 1.737 billion yuan ($280 million) between April and June.\nmengjing@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 07\/30\/2014 page15)\n","740":"Artificial\u00a0intelligence field will embrace most unicorns - tech companies valued at $1 billion or more - in the next decade, and China offers unique opportunities to the industry, said Kaifu Lee, CEO of a technology incubator Innovation Works.\u00a0\nIntelligent robots dance at the main venue for 2016 Qingdao International Beer Festival in Qingdao, East China's Shandong province.

And Chinese AI companies could give full play to local advantages, compared to world-leading ones aiming to enter Chinese market.\nIn addition, the government has mapped out policies to support the development of AI, for example unmanned vehicles.\nThe conference invited more than 30 unicorns, plenty of start-up leaders and venture capitalists, including Legend Holdings Ltd, China Vanke Co Ltd, online video website Youku, Matrix Partners China and GGV Capital.\n\"For every unicorn here, or those who are striving to be a unicorn, you must learn AI technologies to give your business a well-deserved boost,\" Lee said.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/80\/148108809868.jpg\neca86bd9df0419b0cbd904.jpg\n","741":"The combined initiatives of Chinese internet powerhouses Baidu, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings are helping the mainland chip away at the lead held by the United States in artificial intelligence (AI) innovation globally.\u00a0\n\n\"There's still a huge gap between the [research and development spending of] Chinese internet companies and their global peers,\" John Choi, the head of China internet research at Daiwa Capital Markets, said yesterday.\n\nHowever, Choi said ample government support in terms of regulation and research funding, deep pools of AI and engineering talent, private sector investment and large amounts of digital data for deploying machine-learning techniques to existing products would enable the mainland companies \"to narrow that gap quite aggressively over the coming years\".\n\nThat also indicates how Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are likely to continue being well entrenched in the mainland economy through AI after dominating the fields of online search, e-commerce, and online games and social media, respectively, in the country.\n\nAI is an umbrella term covering several technologies that include machine learning, cognitive computing, natural language processing and so-called neural networks. Machine learning, for instance, is a type of AI focused on computer programs that have the ability to learn when exposed to new data.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government announced its national development plan, which included building up a highly competitive AI industry that would be worth 1 trillion yuan (HK$1.18 trillion) by 2030.\n\nChoi said AI was already deeply rooted in many core internet services on the mainland. \"From search engines to content recommendations, Chinese internet companies are folding machine-learning technology into their services with the aim of improving information discovery and monetisation efficiency,\" he said.\n\nNasdaq-listed Baidu, which is considered by Daiwa as one of the pioneers in AI research on the mainland, has sharpened its focus on leading the global market for autonomous driving technology.\n\nIn July, Baidu said more than 50 companies, including 13 Chinese carmakers and two Western vehicle giants - Ford and Daimler - as well as component providers and ride-sharing operators such as China's UCAR and Singapore-based Grab had joined Project Apollo, the company's open autonomous driving platform.\n\n\"We anticipate there being a large addressable market for Baidu's autonomous driving business, though we believe it is unlikely to bring in significant revenue in the next three years,\" Choi said in a recent Daiwa report.\n\nNew York-listed Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, announced last month that it would invest US$15 billion over the next three years into \"cutting-edge technology\", including AI, through its global research effort called Discovery, Adventure, Momentum and Outlook (Damo) Academy.\n\nThis investment will more than double the US$6.4 billion Alibaba spent on research over its past three financial years, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nAlibaba said the Damo Academy will establish new laboratories on the mainland, Singapore, Israel, the US and Russia.\n\n\"We believe Alibaba has a natural edge in AI research that has yet to be fully appreciated,\" said Choi. \"We see multiple use cases for machine learning in Alibaba's existing product range.\"\n","742":"A Hong Kong listed spin off of computer giant Lenovo Group said it has teamed up with some of China's best cancer treatment organisations to boost the country's low tumour survival rate by collecting patients' medical records for big data analysis using artificial intelligence.\nDigital China Holdings, commonly known as DC Holdings, is working with the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the National Cancer Centre to develop the largest nationwide oncologic data centre and big data platform to analyse tumour cases from 30 provincial hospitals, 174 city-level hospitals as well as 1,000 specialised tumour clinics across the country.\u00a0\nThe patient information is exclusive to the company as it was on a \"national mission\" to help raise the odds of curing malignant tumours, Guo Wei, chairman of DC Holdings, said in an interview in Guangzhou.\nMetLife takes up insurtech and will use big data to cover diabetes patients\nThe central government has made the precision medical field a focus of its 13th five-year plan, and Chinese companies have been embarking on ambitious efforts to collect a vast trove of genetic and health data and number crunching that into consumer technologies aimed at saving lives. Unlike many developed nations where individual medical records are considered confidential and their disclosure has raised concerns, Beijing is encouraging medical institutions to work with trusted companies to boost big data applications in health care and clinical research.\nDue to less effective screening technology and poor levels of early diagnosis, cancer is the No 1 cause of deaths among mainland Chinese residents, regardless of whether they live in cities or rural areas. The deadly disease is also a huge financial burden on Chinese families as only a small proportion of the population can afford insurance policies that cover the huge costs of cancer treatment.\nThe survival rate for malignant tumours in China is only about 30 per cent, lower than the global average of 50 per cent and substantially behind the 70 per cent success rate in many developed countries, according to Guo.\n\"Enhancing tumour treatment skills will be a long process. If we can help lift the cure rate to about 40 per cent in 10 years it should be considered a rather huge achievement,\" Guo said.\nChina Resources unit mulls US$377m fund to ride on health care sector growth\nResearch firm IDC has predicted that the volume of global health care data will increase 48 per cent annually through 2020, with health care data generated in China accounting for about 22 per cent of that.\nWith a population of 1.38 billion people, more than 1 billion of whom own smartphones and 750 million are internet users, China has more data for researchers to test out new ideas, said Lu Qi, Baidu's vice-chairman and chief operating officer. Speaking at CES in Las Vegas last week, he said he believes the country's population and strong government support are the key factors that will enable China to catch up to the US in the race to develop artificial intelligence.\nDC Holdings was established in 2000 as a spin-off from Legend Group, subsequently renamed Lenovo Group. Since then the company has transitioned from a traditional IT service provider to a big data specialist using artificial intelligence to provide smart city solutions, including digitalisation of government operations and smart medical initiatives.\nLast week DC Holdings teamed up with Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group to launch a smart city planning institute which includes working with local hospitals to improve health care, according to the company.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

It will allow users to search information by sending voice requests.\n\nBaidu has been ramping up efforts to boost adoption of its autonomous driving technology and DuerOS conversational assistant by opening its platforms to third-party partners, betting big that AI can turn around its business after it was hit hard by a regulatory scandal last year.\n\nAutonomous driving and conversational AI products have so far earned negligible revenue for Baidu, but it posted nearly 30 per cent year-on-year revenue growth in the September quarter as its core online marketing business continues to expand through increased user engagement on its news feed and video products enhanced by AI technology.\n\n\"Strategically, Baidu is incentivised to promote voice over text input to draw users away from traditional smartphone usage where it has less influence and has lost ground to Alibaba and Tencent [Holdings],\" said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research.\n\nPowered by DuerOS 2.0, the Baidu product sells for 1,699 yuan (HK$2,000), about three times Alibaba's smart speaker and four times that of Xiaomi's equivalent product.\n\nThe Raven H has more than 200 skills, ranging from playing music to helping users choose a favourite television series, with search requests done by voice.\n","746":"Among the federal agencies disrupted by the brief US government shutdown was the National Science Foundation (NSF), which spends billions of dollars a year supporting technology-related research.\nSomewhat ironically its partial closure, as a \"non-essential\" government function, came just two days after it published a report showing the US' global dominance of science and technology is fast declining as \"other nations - especially China - continue to rise\".\nThe NSF's announcement via Twitter that \"a lapse in government funding\" had put its \"websites and business applications\" out of action seems to underline the reasons for the narrowing gap.\u00a0\nWhile the United States continued to lead the field last year, spending US$496 billion on research and development, China was a close second on US$408 billion.\n\"Our lead is decreasing in certain areas that are important to our country,\" Maria Zuber, chair of the National Science Board, which oversees the NSF, said in a statement accompanying the report. \"That trend raises concerns about impacts on our economy and workforce, and has implications for our national security.\"\nBy comparison, China's President Xi Jinping made the development of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies a central theme in his address to the Communist Party conclave in October. The inclusion of technology in the leader's most important address underscores the continued push by China's top leaders to identify new pillars for an economy struggling to maintain its rapid growth amid industrial overcapacity and rising debt.\n It also reflects a determination in Beijing that the country not lose out in the global race to master the next wave of technologies such as artificial intelligence, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said is \"more profound\" than electricity or fire.\nChina's investment in R&D has increased an average of 18 per cent every year since 2000, giving it a 21 per cent share of the global industry today, while in the US that spending has risen just 4 per cent. The latter now accounts for 26 per cent of R&D spending worldwide.\nAnd China's share of venture capital funding, which supports emerging technologies, grew from about US$3 billion in 2013 to US$34 billion in 2016, taking it from 5 per cent to 27 per cent of the global total, the report found.\nFor years, Chinese tech companies have cultivated a universe so large that it exists almost exclusively on its own - sustained by the country's 1.4 billion people - but cut off from the rest of the world by Beijing's so-called Great Firewall which blocks content not approved by the government.\nIn part protected from foreign competition, Chinese internet firms like Tencent Holdings and Baidu have flourished, attaining market valuations to rival global firms like Facebook. Meanwhile, outside the firewall, a parallel online ecosystem exists where companies banned in China, like Google, YouTube and Twitter, market their products to the remaining six billion people on the planet.\n\"Apollo [Baidu's self-driving operating system] is an example of 'China Speed', demonstrating the rapid pace of China's innovations and development in the global autonomous driving industry,\" said Lu Qi, the company's vice-chairman and COO, at the recent CES technology trade show held in Las Vegas.\n\"To drive innovation requires infrastructure and a friendly policy environment. Policy innovation is just as important as technology innovation.\"\nStrong government support and the sheer size of the population have helped China to close in on the US in the race to develop artificial intelligence - seen by many as the holy grail of technology - according to Lu. Often dubbed \"China's Google\", Baidu was hand-picked as part of a \"national team\" of tech giants to lead the country's efforts in developing autonomous cars and other AI applications.\nChina recruits Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent to AI 'national team'\nDespite their nurturing domestic environment, Chinese tech firms often find it tricky to enter overseas markets like the US.\nEarlier this month, Huawei was forced to launch its Mate 10 Pro smartphone on the \"open market\", rather than in partnership with US carrier AT&T after the latter backed out of the deal, reportedly because of political pressure. It was the second US-China deal since the start of the year to fall through over national security concerns, after Washington rejected Ant Financial's acquisition of US-based money transfer service MoneyGram International.\nThe US  federal government shutdown is taking place days after the People's Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, spoke of a \"historic opportunity\" to make China great again.\nAs of Tuesday evening in Asia, the NSF website said: \"Due to the lapse in government funding, National Science Foundation websites and business applications will be unavailable until further notice. We sincerely regret this inconvenience.\"\nCopyright (c) 2018. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

Those students then have the option to access assistant lecturers for further face-to-face guidance.\u00a0\nTAL's online classes offer interactive, live broadcasts of lectures on Chinese, English, maths, biology, chemistry and physics. The company said the online-offline model is a cost-effective way to bring education to a wider audience in China.\u00a0\nTAL Education is no stranger to deal making. In the past two years it has made at least 10 acquisitions and minority investments, according to the company's 2017 annual report filed to the US regulator.\u00a0\nFor example, in 2014 it acquired Kaoyan.com, a site designed to help candidates prepare for entrance exams for postgraduate degrees.

The test-takers were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform. The program beat the average score of the test group.\nResearchers took an approach known as \"deep learning\", which involves building up abstract representations of concepts from raw data. The researchers used the method to learn the different representations of words, a technique known as word embedding.\nAnd then they came up with a way to solve the test problems.\nThe AI's results were surprising, although the machine didn't do as well against people with master's or doctorate degrees.\nThe report described the approach: \"First, we build a classifier to recognize the specific type of verbal questions. According to previous studies, verbal questions usually include sub-types like analogy, classification, synonym and antonym.\n\"For different types of questions, different kinds of relationships need to be considered and the solvers could have different forms. Therefore,\nwith an effective question-type classifier, we may solve the questions in a divide-and-conquer manner and achieve high accuracy.\n\"Second, we obtain distributed representations of words and relations by leveraging a novel word-embedding method that considers the multi-sense nature of words and the relational knowledge among words (or their senses) contained in dictionaries.\n\"For each polysemous word (those with multiple meanings), we retrieve its number of senses from a dictionary, and conduct clustering on all its context windows in the corpus.\n\"Third, for each specific type of questions, we propose a simple yet effective solver based on the obtained distributed word representations and relation representations.\"\nThe report said the researchers then attached \"the example sentences for every sense in the dictionary to the clusters, such that we can tag the polysemous word in each context window with a specific word sense\".\nIt said that \"the learning of word-sense representations and relation representations interacts with each other, to effectively incorporate the relational knowledge obtained from dictionaries\".\nThey concluded that \"the results are highly encouraging, indicating that with appropriate uses of the deep learning technologies, we could be a further small step closer to human intelligence\".\nActually, I kind of had some trouble comprehending the report, which means I would probably lose to the computer.\nThe researchers were encouraged: \"In the future, we plan to leverage more types of knowledge from the knowledge graph ... to enhance the power of obtaining word-sense and relation embeddings. Moreover, we will explore new frameworks based on deep learning or other AI techniques to solve other parts of IQ tests beyond verbal comprehension questions.\"\nThe research team included Huazheng Wang and Fei Tian, of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, Anhui province, and researchers Bin Yao, Tie-Yan Liu and Jiang Bian at Microsoft.\nContact the writer at williamhennelly@chinadailyusa.com\n","753":"A robot named \"Xian'Er\", is represented by its author Master Xianshu during the National Day Gala at Dragon Spring Temple in Beijing, Oct. 1, 2015. \"Xian'Er\" robot monk, the protagonist of cartoon series \"Trouble, you seek for yourself\" published by Longquan (Dragon Spring) Temple, is developed by the temple with artificial intelligence experts, which is able to sense its surroundings and answer questions about Buddhism.

But beware, the V2 will get annoyed if its user repeatedly presses the same button on its remote control.\n The inventors believe its personality is on a par with the fictitious droid C3PO.\n And just like C3PO's relationship with chirpy sidekick R2D2, Robosapien V2 can interact with companions.\n WowWee has developed two of these - Roboraptor, a dinosaur-like creature with sensors across its body that respond to touch, sound or movement, and Robopet, which can sit, lie down and roll over.\n \"Now that we've got robots playing with each other, the next thing we can do is get rid of children,\" joked Phillip Duffy, creative director for WowWee.\n Compared to its predecessor, the V2 has a neck that allows its head to turn and track moving objects, and he stands about 25cm higher, at 60cm.\n Its body has also gained more movement in its various joints with the addition of 14 individual motors - twice as many as were used in the original design.\n The more advanced mechanics allow it to sit down, stand up, or lie down and watch television with children.\n The V2 is expected to be priced at $ 2,000, considerably higher than the $ 699 that was asked for its previous incarnation.\n Its inventors insist that the upgrades will make the V2 \"four times the robot\".\n Roboraptor and Robopet will retail for at least $ 1,000 and $ 700, respectively.\n The Hong Kong-born V2 and its friends are expected to begin invading toy-store shelves around the world in October.\n Meanwhile, Dr Tilden said the company was working on a third-generation robot that will recognise voice commands, eliminating the need to use a control pad.\n","755":"Chinese consumers have high expectations for the application of artificial intelligence in smart homes, healthcare, automobile and transportation, security and fitness, even though the current utilization rate of such devices is relatively low, a new survey said on Tuesday.\u00a0\nAbout 64.7 percent of consumers in China own digital voice-enabled assistants, but less than 20 percent of them use these assistants frequently, global consultancy firm Accenture said in a study covering 4,060 consumers in 252 cities across the country.\nMore than 40 percent of Chinese consumers possess wearable devices and 30.8 percent use them every day, while 52.3 percent utilize them occasionally.\nAbout 55 percent of consumers expect AI technologies to be applied in smart home systems, followed by healthcare, automobile, security and fitness.\n\"The reason lies in these intelligent hardware devices just providing a human-machine interaction interface. They don't bring about any subversive experiences or change consumers' behaviors,\" said Yu Jin, strategy lead for Accenture China.\nConsumers across the globe revealed increasing demand and deeper interactions with standalone voice assistants. Chinese consumers who use voice assistants accounted for 55 percent and were ranked first in the world, nearly 10 percent higher than their US counterparts.\nHowever, consumers face challenges when using intelligent devices, especially digital voice assistants. Voice recognition not working properly is the most common challenge for consumers, according to Accenture.\nThese assistants have yet to be developed, with insufficient application scenarios, which are lower than consumers' expectations, said Huang Weiqiang, managing director of Accenture China.\nHuang said with the rapid development of big data and machine learning, AI will penetrate into fields that are related to people's daily lives, such as automobiles, con-sumer goods, retail, finance and healthcare.\nAccenture also said nearly 40 percent of consumers have already bought intelligent home appliance products, and nearly 60 percent of them use them frequently, higher than the proportion of voice assistants.\nTraditional home appliance manufacturers are pressing ahead with smart home products, such as air conditioners, televisions and refrigerators, by applying artificial intelligence technologies to transform and innovate products, as well as to grab a larger market share.\nThe consultancy said in a survey released last year that AI could accelerate China's economic growth rate from 6.3 percent to 7.9 percent by 2035, by transforming the nature of work and opening new sources of value and growth.\nThe report also said that AI has the potential to boost China's labor productivity by 27 percent by 2035 - driven by innovative AI technologies that enable people to make more efficient use of their time.

The faces of young, hopeful students smile out of the yellowing pages. Thirty-five years later, it is captivating to remember them as they were.\nIt was an act of unintended brilliance to establish a real time Facebook internet platform - and to get the punters to provide unlimited reality content. It was the age of innocence. What could possibly go wrong?\nThere is a cartoon circulating with a speech bubble over a kid saying to Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, \"My dad says you're spying on us.\" Zuckerberg replies, \"He's not your dad!\"\u00a0\nWhy does Google, Facebook, or any digital platform need to know where you have been, your private contact lists, and your complete user traffic over the last decade? It's all for your own good. To help you. How else can Google tell you that there is a restaurant, or ATM, or petrol station nearby? And it's free because your data, combined with that of millions of others, can be exploited.\nBig Zucker is watching: Facebook has realised Orwell's dystopia\nIt can tag your face; it knows where you live, what social events you like, every video you've watched, and every friend, or unfriend. Cross-reference that with billions of other records; and multiply that by the data that Apple, Dropbox, Samsung and others who pass your data through their clouds. Somewhere, someone can find something about you that even you have forgotten. No wonder marketers, canvassers, and security services will pay big bucks for access to your data.\nWhere did the delivery of useful but insignificant information turn into an aggressive sales pitch? If advertisers can find out that I like aeroplanes, rugby, cars, the stock market, and have an adopted grandson - they can get my attention. Today, I am targeted by hotels that I visited two years ago. Tomorrow, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal has showed, psychological profiling and artificial intelligence could predict where I want to go. Before I know myself.\nFacebook warned by Hong Kong privacy watchdog on data security\nA recent panel on artificial intelligence at the Harvard Business School had the audience noisy on the prospect of machine learning but silent on the questions of privacy, cybercrime and cyber warfare. The privacy genie is out of the bottle - we cannot rely on our secrets remaining undisturbed. Not in the US; not in Russia; not in China where data is now deliberately used to award social credits that \"reward\" good behaviour. Where does good behaviour stop and national security begin? Only Europe is properly tackling privacy by threatening big fines for companies infringing the new General Data Protection Regulations. Even if your data is not sold, it can be hacked - indeed, it may have already been hacked.\nFacebook introduces features for users to download, delete their data\nMost users will continue to ignore privacy issues, as they cannot see the consequences. Indeed, only in the last year have we begun to understand that social platforms can be used to display scenes of violence, fake news, hate speech, and theft of identities and secrets. Facebook has been caught peddling data that we never knew was acquired; caught cross referencing it for advertisers; caught avoiding taxes; caught having self-serving terms of use; caught being used for political campaigning; caught having inadequate safeguards for its 2 billion customers. What was started as something innocent has already been twisted malevolently.\nFacebook is the new religion; it is the new opiate of the masses. As a result, it is now the seventh largest listed company in the world, claiming 30 per cent of humanity as its customers - and it was only founded 14 years ago. Crack cocaine was never more addictive.\nThis is a turning point for privacy regulation in the West. It will result in inhibitions for social networks to grab and sell bulk data. That will make them less valuable as economic entities. Facebook is largely a one trick pony, a single use platform, unlike Amazon, Apple and Google. All industries spark, shine and decline, as did canals, coal, steel, cars, TV, photographic film, cassette tapes and the CD. Unless Facebook changes its strategy, its meteoric growth is threatened and it will move towards becoming a utility. Perhaps that is the reason why it has lost a quarter of its value on the stock market since the end of January.\nFacebook may decline in prominence because of US regulation, but elsewhere around the world, privacy will be honoured in the breach. Your data is too valuable.

Mr Kwok said Hong Kong IT professionals did not view programming as a worthwhile profession.\n \"Everyone wants to become systems analysts and project managers when, in fact, there are  interesting career opportunities for programmers,\" he said.\n Radica was trying to overcome the problem by paying programmers attractive salaries and focusing greater attention on career opportunities.\n The company supports and sponsors further education and sends its employees to overseas trade shows and conventions.\n Mr Kwok also believes that recruiting employees from diverse education and work experience backgrounds brings new insights and problem-solving skills to the company.\n Radica's headcount consists of engineers, sales and marketing professionals, communication personal and even employees with an arts background.\n Established in 2000 at the same time as the dotcom implosion saw large numbers of IT firms collapse, Radica is the first Hong Kong University of Science and Technology spin-off firm to locate its headquarters in HKSTP.\n","760":"Robin Li Yanhong, the founder, chairman and chief executive of Baidu, is feeling pretty good about himself nowadays.\n\nOne of the mainland's richest person with an estimated wealth of US$18.3 billion, Li just appeared on the cover of Time, joining the likes of Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos among tech luminaries to be featured on the magazine.\n\u00a0\nThe share price of Baidu has been hitting new highs as investors rediscover the Beijing-based company, popularly known as \"China's Google\". Like its American counterpart, the company has in recent years bet heavily on artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We started to deploy AI about six or seven years ago,\" Li said at the GeekPark forum in Beijing on Sunday, according to a transcript of his comments verified by Baidu. \"Now that AI has become \u00admature enough to have some use in the market, we feel relatively more relaxed, feel that this day has finally come.\"\n\nIt has not always been easy- going for Baidu. Just three years back, investors deserted the company in droves after it missed the shift to mobile internet services. Unlike its rivals, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, the firm failed to create the web of \"sticky\" interconnected mobile apps needed to attract sufficient consumers and their money.\n\nShares in Baidu plunged almost 50 per cent from a peak in November 2014 to a trough about 10 months later. At one point in June last year, JD.com, the mainland's second-largest e-commerce company, almost overtook Baidu in market valuation.\n\nLi said many people had advised him back in 2002 and 2003 to prepare for the mobile internet, warning him that an age of untethered web access centred on the mobile phone was coming. But Baidu did not listen because \"we didn't know how to make mobile internet better\", he said.\n\n\"My feeling at that time was: how important can the mobile phone be? The screen is so small, the speed is so slow, you have to pay for every byte. So we felt we weren't ready,\" Li said.\n\n\"With time, this attitude led to a sort of numbness, a feeling that it may not come at all, maybe it'll take another year or two.\n\n\"Until around 2011 when the mobile internet era really came about, many people had already positioned themselves and we had not. That was bad. At that time, we did indeed panic a little.\"\n\nThe company suffered another blow in May 2016 when a college student died after seeking cancer treatment from an advertisement on Baidu, sparking a public debate on the role internet companies should play in vetting claims of its advertisers.\n\nThe government imposed limits on health-care-related advertisements the company could carry.\n\nFast-forward to November 2017 and Baidu was included in a hand-picked \"national team\" of technology champions, alongside Alibaba and Tencent, and tasked to lead others to develop their \u00adrespective areas of expertise.\n\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nFor Baidu, the goal was to build an open-source platform for autonomous driving to rival those being developed in the traditional motoring powerhouses of Germany, Japan and the United States.\n\nLu Qi, Baidu's vice-chairman and chief operating officer, said last month at the CES technology show in Las Vegas that China, with its strong government support and population size, was well \u00adpositioned to close the gap with the US in AI.\n\nBaidu made several major changes last year to remake itself as an AI-first company, ramping up efforts in autonomous driving and launching DuerOS, its conversational computing platform.\n\nStill, the company has yet to see large-scale returns from its \u00adinvestments in AI, which may still take some time, according to Sun Mengqi, an analyst with Bank of Communication International Holdings.\n\nBut the firm was positioned to earn fees as the use of AI became more widespread and the number of users increased, Sun said.\n\nIn terms of personnel, Baidu lost a number of key executives last year, including Andrew Ng, the former chief scientist who started Google Brain.\n\nLi said hiring Lu from Microsoft Corp had given him the room to \"zoom out\".\n\n\"I now have six to seven peo-ple report to me directly, down from more than a dozen,\" Li said. \"That enables me to see the \u00adcompany from a distance and get a clearer picture on what the company looks like, what the market looks like and what our \u00adfuture looks like.\"\n","761":"Technological achievements in China, such as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, have laid a solid foundation for the transformation of Chinese media as the industry seeks better development amid a changing environment, media professionals and industry leaders said at a forum on Saturday.\u00a0\nRapid advances in internet technology have brought significant changes to Chinese people's lifestyles in recent years. An increasing number of people read the news online, pushing traditional media to transform itself by integrating with new media.\n\"Media integration requires support from new technologies,\" said Tuo Zhen, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.\n\"To achieve integrated development, (media) need to be technology-sensitive.

So when the era of AI comes, I think our chance to create chips and processors to power the brain of AI has arrivedYu Kai, Horizon Robotics\nAn AI wave is sweeping the mainland's technology industry after the government identified it as a strategic sector to support. At the centre of that push is a plan to build a 1 trillion yuan (HK$1.2 trillion) AI industry by 2030, and integral to that is developing home-grown firms able to produce enough processors to cut the country's spending of more than US$200 billion on imported chips.\u00a0\n\nAs the world's largest market for semiconductors, China has so far failed to break the dominance of United States companies Intel and Qualcomm in making central processing units, which are brains of computers and smartphones.\n\nHowever, a growing number of mainland chip start-ups, including Horizon, are emerging to challenge the incumbents.\n\nVenture capitalists invested more than US$1.5 billion in chip start-ups globally last year, nearly double the investments in 2016, according to CB Insights, a research company.\n\nHorizon was about to begin a new round of fundraising seeking hundreds of millions of dollars, Yu said, taking advantage of investor interest in the sector.\n\n\"For us, the bubble in the industry is just like the froth on beer, it only makes the beer taste better,\" he said. \"We don't need to work hard to educate investors on the importance of AI chips to get funding, we can now simply focus on what we do the best.\"\n\nHorizon is valued by investors at more than US$1 billion and aims to become the \"Intel in AI era\" by developing processors that allow manufacturers to embed AI into many types of devices.\u00a0\n\nYu helped set up search-engine giant Baidu's \"deep learning\" research institute in Silicon Valley and Beijing in 2013 and later, the company's autonomous driving unit. He also helped recruit Andrew Ng, the scientist behind Google Brain, to Baidu in 2014.\n\nThe start-up counts venture capital firms such as Morningside Venture Capital, Hillhouse Capital and Sequoia Capital among its investors and is on track to mass produce chips that enable cars to fully drive themselves under most circumstances.\u00a0\n\nLi Jingwang, an analyst at Beijing-based market consultancy IT Juzi, said chips embedded with AI were critical for applications in which fast decisions were needed.\n\n\"For drones or autonomous cars, a difference of even several milliseconds could be fatal,\" Li said. \"A built-in AI solution is very important because these applications cannot afford to take time in processing all the relevant data to a cloud-based AI platform. What if the internet is slow?\"\n\nYu said the near-term goal for Horizon was to develop chips that not only enabled devices such as cars to see their surroundings, but to also make decisions based on what they saw.\u00a0\n\nCars and smart cameras are the markets that hold the most commercial potential for Horizon, according to Yu, who sits on a panel of experts convened by the country's science and technology ministry on AI strategic planning.\n\nIn a recent demonstration by Horizon, a sport utility vehicle equipped with its so-called BPU - or brain processing unit - chips are able to correctly identify cars, pedestrians, traffic signs and \u00adother targets in real time within a 200- metre radius using only one camera. That is in contrast to many carmakers and technology companies that are developing laser-based systems that send out infrared pulses to build a 3D map of the surroundings.\u00a0\n\nHorizon's chips were 10 times cheaper than an equivalent laser-based system, Yu said.\n\nHe said most AI services were dependent on the cloud to answer even simple questions, citing smart assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri.\n\nHe said the devices were there to just capture images and voices and pass all the data to the cloud, leading to high power consumption, high bandwidth costs and cloud storage.\n\n\"With our chips, which are already embedded with AI capacity, the devices can process what they see where they are, no need to send all the data back and wait for a result,\" he said.\u00a0\n\nYu's work day stretches 15 hours every day, and he logged 230,000km in the air last year.\n\n\"I'm much busier now compared with my time at Baidu,\" he said. \"But I'm doing something I'm passionate about, so there are no regrets.\"\n","764":"China's domestic security and \u00adintelligence chief has called on the country's police to use artificial\u00a0\u00adintelligence (AI) to improve their \u00adability to predict and prevent \u00adterrorism and social unrest.\u00a0\n\nMeng Jianzhu, head of the Communist Party's central commission for political and legal affairs in charge of the country's massive security and intelligence systems, pledged at a meeting in Beijing on Tuesday to use AI through machine learning, data mining and computer modelling to help address risks to stability.\n\n\"Artificial\u00a0intelligence can complete tasks with a precision and speed unmatchable by humans, and will drastically \u00adimprove the predictability, \u00adaccuracy and efficiency of social management,\" Meng was quoted as saying by mainland news \u00adwebsite Thepaper.cn yesterday.\n\nMeng said security forces should study patterns that might be spotted in cases of terrorist attacks and public security incidents and build a data analysis model to improve the authorities' ability to predict such events and stop them taking place.\n\nMeng said the security services should break down any barriers in data sharing to enable the smooth integration of various systems. He also called for new efforts to integrate all footage from surveillance cameras around the country.\n\nIt is not the first time the security chief has stressed the need for high technology to strengthen the country's sprawling surveillance network to help combat crime.\n\nMeng said last month during an inspection of the restive Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in the mainland's west that large-scale use of cloud computing and AI, as well as analysis of \"big data\", should be used to fight terrorism.\n\nZunyou Zhou, a counter\u00adterrorism law expert at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law, warned that unbridled government access to massive amounts of personal data could lead to abuse. \"China has no specific data protection law.

[Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]\nYu Zhichen, founder and CEO of Turning Robot, shared with China Daily website his ambitious Chinese dream of placing an artificial intelligent robot into every household, on November 24 at the World Robot Conference 2015 in Beijing.\u00a0\nTurning Robot was established and launched its first generation product on November 6, 2014.\n1. The idea of \"mass entrepreneurship and innovation\" was first raised by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during the Summer Davos in September 2014. Turning Robot was just born shortly after the idea was created and completely fit in both entrepreneurship and innovation. What's your idea of \"mass entrepreneurship and innovation\"?\nA: From a macro point of view, the idea raised by the government would create a better environment to support innovation and the development of entrepreneurs. It has positive significance, especially in the capital sector. With government support and guidance, the entire industry will be greatly promoted.\nFrom the micro point of view, companies still have to recognize their own position and values. The social atmosphere will stimulate innovation and enthusiasm; however, the probability of success and failure is half to half.\n2. Many tech giants, such as Baidu, Microsoft and Google, are all making huge investments in the artificial intelligence field, both money and human resources. Compared with such tech behemoths, what do you think are Turning Robot's advantages?\nA: I think the advantages are relative. For big companies, their overall investment is undoubtedly huge, larger than any other start-up companies. But in some certain areas, where the startups input all their money and human resources, the big companies are weaker.\nTurning Robot invested more financial and human resources in the household artificial intelligent robot field than any other big companies, including Baidu, Microsoft and IBM.\nBesides making too dispersed investments, the big companies are more focused on research, other than practical application. We need not only technology, but also good product managers. Both research and products are equally important to the development of artificial intelligence.\n3. Chinese is one of the world's most complex languages. On the launching ceremony of Turning OS earlier this month, you announced that our Chinese semantic understanding accuracy rate was 94.7 percent and the man-machine dialogue accuracy rate was 88.2. These are amazing figures. How did you calculate these figures?\nA: We made over 1 million tests every week to get these figures and have full intellectual property rights of these technologies.\nAlthough we are a small company, we have a dedicated team for intellectual property rights. We invest about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan every month in intellectual property R&D and applications and own 110 patents now.\nChina's intellectual property protection improved a lot in recent years and I believe it will be better in the future. The big companies turned to purchasing patents from small firms instead of plagiarizing them.\nThe government should do more in intellectual property protection to build a better environment to support innovation and entrepreneurship, especially in the artificial intelligent robot field, which relies heavily on technology..\n4. What do you expect of China's artificial intelligent robot market? And how will China's affect the world?\nA: I am not quite optimistic about industrial robots, because the core technologies are controlled by several foreign countries, such as Japan and Germany. But for household robots, China is at the same starting line with the world and even a leading player in some areas, such as man-machine interactive robots.\nChina has surpassed the United States in investment, innovation and the market in this area and has a better household robot market environment than the US.\nChina is facing the intersection of traditional manufacturing industry upgrading and technological innovation, which offers great opportunity for the development of artificial intelligence. The unique Chinese model will be a reference to the world.\n5. What do you think about the Chinese dream? What are the dreams you have for your company in China?\nA: I think letting people give full play to their potential and realize their value is the Chinese dream. No matter if they are in Beijing or Shanghai, those people who have ideas can start up their businesses at a relatively low threshold.\nChina is short of capable companies in some basic core technologies, although we have a big market and have developed for many years. I hope to build Turning Robot into a famous Chinese company in operating systems and bring an artificial intelligent robot into every household.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/93\/144859425860.jpg\nb083fe955aa117c1d2a807.jpg\n","766":"The all-seeing God's Eye, a system that can hack into any camera and locate anyone, anywhere in less than four minutes is one of the stars of the two latest instalments of the Fast and Furious blockbuster movie franchise.\n\nIn China's most innovative city, Shenzhen, two US-educated Chinese scientists have found a way to turn an element of God's Eye into reality in the form of a chip inserted into surveillance cameras.\n\nWith the chip, a surveillance camera can greatly speed up \u00adhuman facial recognition and spot a criminal suspect in a crowd in just a few seconds. It has proved effective in at least in one district in Shenzhen and, according to publicly disclosed information, has helped police crack hundreds of cases and find a number of lost children.\u00a0\n\nThe firm behind it, Intelli\u00adfusion, is just one of the fruits of the mainland's efforts to become a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI), a technology that may profoundly change everyday life and that promises massive financial pay-offs.\n\nThe mainland's AI ambitions were emphasised at the annual meeting of the National People's Congress in March and the \u00admessage was not lost on the country's biggest tech companies.\n\nBeijing's efforts to close the \u00adinnovation gap with the United States have since been given a big boost, with billions of dollars \u00adinvested in AI laboratories and projects.\n\nBaidu president Zhang Yaqin says his company, China's equivalent of Google, invests more than 15 per cent of its revenue in \u00adresearch and development every year, much of it on AI.\n\nIt set up a national deep-learning technology lab in Beijing in March, drawing on the talents of its own AI experts and others from Tsinghua University, Beijing \u00adUniversity of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the China \u00adAcademy of Information and Communications Technology.\n\nMessaging and gaming behemoth Tencent recruited the former head of Baidu's Big Data Lab, Zhang Tong, last month to lead a team of more than 50 AI scientists and 200 engineers at its AI lab, which focuses on computer vision, voice recognition, natural language processing and \u00admachine learning. Its AI Go \u00adprogram Yueyi won the Computer Go UEC Cup in Japan in March.\n\nAI's potential was demonstrated in January when DeepMind's AlphaGo, playing under the name \"Master\", won 51 online Go matches against some of the world's best players. Go, a game at least 300 times more difficult than chess, is viewed as a good test of artificial intelligence because of its many permutations and combinations of moves. AlphaGo will be taking on the world's top-ranked player, China's Ke Jie, in a best-of-three series in Wuzhen, Zhejiang (   ) province, next week.\n\nAccording to recent research by UBS, AI could produce economic value of between US$1.8 trillion and US$3 trillion a year by 2030 in Asia by introducing new product services and categories, cost savings arising from better products, lower overall prices and improvements in lifestyles.\n\nData provider i-Research predicts China's AI market will be worth US$ 9.1 billion in 2020 after growing at an annual compound rate of 50 per cent.\n\nThat's been encouraging growing numbers of overseas-trained Chinese researchers to \u00adreturn to the mainland to explore AI opportunities and industrialise their technologies.\n\nThe mainland, with US$2.6 billion, ranked second globally in terms of investment in AI enterprises and start-ups last year, sandwiched between the United States at US$17.9 billion and \u00adBritain at US$ 800 million, according to data from the WuZhen \u00adInstitute think tank.\n\nIntellifusion, a start-up founded in Shenzhen three years ago by two artificial intelligence \u00adexperts - Chen Ning and Tian \u00adDihong - who returned to the mainland from the United States, is one of the firms breaking new ground.\n\n\"The mainland market is the best choice in the world for talented research scientists to bring their AI technology from lab to life and make it possible for scalable AI products,\" Chen said, while acknowledging there were more developed AI technologies and more experienced AI talent in the US.\n\n\"While there's no doubt artificial intelligence is the new \u00adfrontier, the foundation for the technology is still not mature.\"\n\nThe winner would not be the one with the best algorithm, Chen said, but the one with the most data. \"In the AI sector, China is a fast starter,\" he said. \"The mainland market, with its huge population, means you can launch AI products quicker, collect more data and upgrade your algorithm faster, and then lower your cost to compete for bigger market share.\"\n\nUS-based graphics processing unit (GPU) maker Nvidia predicts there will be a billion surveillance cameras watching people around the world by 2020, presenting the massive challenge of working out exactly how to deal with that giant deluge of data.\n\nThat's where an \"intelligent chip\" designed by Chen and Tian's company, Intellifusion, stands to cash in.\n\nThe authorities in Shenzhen, dubbed China's Silicon Valley, have invested in the start-up and given it other support. But some people have expressed concern about the privacy implications of the technology.\n\nAbout 100,000 public surveillance cameras across the city will be using Intellifusion's chips by the end of this year.\n\nThey enable police to identify an individual in just a second or two from a database of about300 million people and most \u00adsurveillance cameras in Shenzhen will be fitted with them by next year.\n\nChen and Tian worked together at the Georgia Institute of Technology's Centre for Signal and Image Processing 15 to 16 years ago. Their company now employs about 100 people.\n\nChief executive Chen, 42, said Intellifusion's chip was much more effective than the traditional CPU (central processing unit) and GPU chips.\n\n\"An effective front-end AI-powered chip for visual intelligence is a must in future, to make the machines not only see the world, but also understand the world and conduct local real-time processing,\" Chen said. \"Our chips in cameras can preprocess video data, detect and extract targeted facial characteristics, and translate them into arrays of \u00adbinary data, which are uploaded to the cloud for final processing.\"\n\nChen and Tian, who specialises in visual computing and led tech teams at Samsung and Cisco, decided in 2014 to resign from American tech giant employers and return to Shenzhen to start their own AI business.\n\nTheir decision, reached after two days of conversation, paid off the next year when they won an innovation competition for international talent under Shenzhen's Peacock Plan, an ambitious city government programme to \u00adrecruit and support top hi-tech \u00adresearchers. They attracted more than 40 million yuan (HK$45.2 million) in funding and subsidies from the Shenzhen authorities in 2015. That success boosted their national profile and Intellifusion's products are now used in more than 10 mainland provinces and also in Malaysia.\n\nIn its first round of financing in March last year, the start-up attracted US dollar investment in the eight-figure range from Chinese venture capital funds.\n\n\"Top-level Chinese AI experts are rich in advantageous resources in the mainland market,\" eSight Technology founder Huang Bufu said. With a PhD in mechanical design and automation from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, he founded a start-up in Shenzhen focusing on machine vision development for industrial robots in Pearl River Delta factories.\n\nHuang said his company, with about 20 staff, had completed its first round of financing, with investment from several mainland venture capital funds.\n\n\"Based in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, AI start-ups can reach various venture funds across the country and benefit from preferential policies from \u00adlocal government, not only for the projects and start-ups, but also for human resources,\" he said.\n\nHuang said several friends who had earned PhDs in Hong Kong had decided to follow him across the border to explore the opportunities for AI start-ups on the mainland.\n\nThe flood of investment into AI on the mainland has spurred calls for public debate over the ethical and moral implications of technology such as robots, cameras with \"brains\" and autonomous cars.\n\n\"While governments make \u00adIntellifusion's chips a hi-tech showcase in the cities, arming public surveillance cameras to make cities safer, the rights to \u00adprivacy of the citizens they track must not be forgotten,\" Wang \u00adCairong, secretary general of the China Artificial Intelligence Robot Industry Alliance, said.\n\nChen said the AI tide could not be turned back, but better rules were needed.\n\n\"The governments and scientists need to sit down together to think carefully about how to \u00adrevise current rules and laws for AI development,\" he said. \"In the future, the laws and the ethical rules will not just be for human beings, but also for human-computer interaction.\"\n","767":"Internet giant Baidu is expected to report solid results for the second quarter, in line with market estimates, as the mainland's largest online search engine operator steps up its transformation into a global powerhouse in artificial \u00adintelligence.\n\nAnalysts expect Nasdaq-listed Baidu to provide on Thursday \u00adfurther details about its AI strategy, following the State Council's \u00adannouncement last week of an ambitious national development plan for the technology.\n\u00a0\n\"Laying out a road map for AI is a very encouraging sign of support from the government,\" Jefferies analyst Karen Chan said.\n\nBaidu is forecast to post a 21 per cent increase in net profit to 3.4 billion yuan (HK$3.9 billion) in the three months to June from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts' estimates.\n\nJefferies attributed the gain to a rise in average spending per \u00adonline advertising customer and Baidu's efforts to control its traffic acquisition cost.\n\nRevenue is estimated to grow 14 per cent to 20.7 billion yuan, which would represent the midpoint of Baidu's second-quarter revenue guidance of 20.5 billion to 20.9 billion yuan.\n\nThis week, investors were likely to focus on Baidu's search re\u00adcovery outlook, mobile newsfeed advertising traction, content investment and spending on sales and marketing, Chan said.\n\nIn the first quarter, the firm maintained its lead in total search revenue on the mainland with a 75.9 per cent market share, according to data from Analysys International and Jefferies.\n\nGoogle China seized a 10.2 per cent share while Sohu subsidiary Sogou had an 8.4 per cent share.\n\nA regulatory filing by Baidu last month said its first-quarter search revenue fell 6 per cent from a year ago following its rigid customer verification process last year to \u00adremove low-quality advertisers.\n\n\"We see the elimination of unqualified advertisers resulted in decreased bidding intensity for keywords in certain industries such as 'health care',\" Daiwa Capital Markets analyst John Choi said in a report.\n\nChan expected Baidu to add three billion yuan this year to its annual research and development budget of about 10 billion yuan, saying the incremental increase would be mostly spent on AI initiatives.\n\nChoi said the company already led the mainland's internet sector in AI spending.\n\nThe country's total investments in AI enterprises reached US$2.6 billion last year, according to domestic think tank Wuzhen Institute.\n\nThe United States topped that list with US$17.9 billion during the period.\n\n\"Search is one of the first ap\u00adplications of AI where search works to understand humans,\" Robin Li Yanhong, the co-founder, chairman and chief executive of Baidu, said during a conference call in April.\n\n\"As the leading search engine in China, we have been fortunate to amass vast amounts of rich, valuable data in a market with more than 700 million internet users who speak the same language, have the same culture and abide by the same laws.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Li stressed the importance of opening up the company's AI platform to \u00addevelopers.\n\nThat approach would help Baidu's DuerOS, a conversation-based AI technology, become the Android operating system for the AI era. DuerOS is targeted for use in smart home appliances, cars and wearable devices.\n\nBaidu has recently launched its Apollo 1.0 autonomous driving platform with more than 50 industry partners, including major carmakers and automotive component suppliers.\n\n\"While we applaud Baidu's commitment to open up its AI technology platform ... we are not too sure about what the ultimate business model would be,\" said Alicia Yap, the head of regional internet research at Citi Research in Hong Kong.\n","768":"Investors and analysts signaled early warnings on Thursday after Tencent Holdings Ltd announced further plans to invest in content and technology that could put a dent in its short-term gains.\u00a0\nPlowing into artificial intelligence, video and smart-retail related infrastructure could benefit Tencent's long-term prospects but could be a drag on imminent profitability, Asia's most valuable firm told investors on Wednesday, when it reported latest quarterly earnings with mixed results.\nPrice of the firm's Hong Kong-listed shares dipped 5.01 percent to HK$439.4 ($56) on Thursday.\nTencent beat market expectations by a wide margin on net profit, which almost doubled to market projections in part due to a faster-than-expected 12 percent slowdown in PC gaming sales, still a staple for Tencent.\n\"While total revenue growth of 51 percent was solid given such a high base, the magnitude of gaming revenues missed caught many by surprise,\" said Alicia Yap, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\nMaintaining a \"Buy\" rating, the brokerage has lowered revenue from Yixin to ZhongAn Insurance, have helped it register gains and boost operating margins, the company said.\nBut after stripping out this category, operating margin has in effect slid from 29.4 percent a year ago to 26.8 percent, according to Tim Culpan, a seasoned technology columnist for Bloomberg.\nMeanwhile, the company is diversifying its sources of income. Online advertising sales soared 49 percent, as Tencent became more adept at monetizing its iconic WeChat app that claims more than 1 billion users globally.\nSocial and other ads claimed more than two-thirds of the online advertising segment, as people spend more time on the ubiquitous app to read news, play games and pay for a plethora of online and offline services.\nTencent said it will plan big budgets to acquire video and subsidize payment adoption this year, while other areas earmarked for further investment include cloud services, artificial intelligence and smart retail.\nLi Yujie, an analyst at RHB Group, said the major driver for growth in the next few years would be WeChat's monetization, which can take the form of smart retail, social commerce and social advertising.\nhewei@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 03\/23\/2018 page17)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/65\/152176615342.jpg\na41f726b05111c1e86bd20.jpg\n","770":"AI makes it possible for people to receive a checkup in offices and receive medical advice online, which can lead to a revolution of the healthcare industry in China.\nLi Xiaoxia, left, founder and CEO of Beijing Koboro Health Science and Technology, talks with Yang Song, product director of Koboro, in Beijing on Sept 6, 2017.

She has recently been rated as a top 10 female entrepreneur in tech in a report released by Ali Research Institute, China Entrep Mulan Club and Alibaba Innovation Center.\nBig companies like Google, Microsoft and Alibaba have started to tap into the AI-powered medical care market in recent years, Xinhua reported.\n\"Although healthcare big data systems are still in their infancy across the world, China has an opportunity to take a leading role. China's increasing senior population provides a large amount of data,\" Li said.\nChina had more than 230 million people aged 60 or above at the end of 2016,16.7 percent of the total population, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Elderly people in China are expected to account for about one quarter of the population by 2030, Xinhua reported.\n\"All the products of Koboro are based on fundamental needs of doctors and use the 'Internet Plus healthcare' model to achieve the ultimate goal of helping clients stay healthy in a full life cycle,\" product director Yang Song said.\nKoboro divides clients' life cycles into 13 stages from a half year before birth to more than 90 years old. Clients at different stages can receive professional medical suggestions, running the gamut from Western medicine to traditional Chinese medicine, Li said.\nLiang Wei, a health management doctor at Koboro, displayed a health report of a 26-year-old female whose \"body age\" is about 51 years old.\n\"Based on this person's health check and basic information, the AI-supported system can predict the risks for her to get certain diseases.

She has invested recent years' profits in AI-supported systems and relevant products.\nLi, who is confident in the future of Koboro, said the profits can be in the tens of millions or even several billion in the future, as internet healthcare can generate profits from various channels, such as health management services and healthcare products.\nInspired by her father, who used to be a barefoot doctor, Li also wants to have a close relationship with patients by being there whenever they need support. This is difficult when people are busy andfly todifferent places.\n\"Thanks to developments in bigdata, AI and internet technology, it is possible to standardize the process to prevent and control chronic diseases and establish a healthcare platform online to benefit more ordinary people in China,\" Li said.\nThe great business opportunities emerging in the industry in China also come from the Chinese government's support, Li added.\nIn Oct 2016, Chinese authorities released \"Healthy China 2030\", a blueprint that aims to improve the health of the people. The blueprint covers areas such as public health services, the medical industry and food and drug safety, China Daily reported.\nThis document is not only the first national-level medium- to long-term strategic plan in the health sector since 1949, but also demonstrates the political commitment of China to participate in global health governance and fulfill the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals agenda, according to the World Health Organization.\n","771":"Long lines and lengthy waits for round after round of security checks are di rigueur at major events in China such as the annual meetings of its legislature.\nThat may change in the near future with the use of facial recognition to red-flag people for further screening while allowing others to proceed, speeding up the process of letting thousands of delegates, journalists and staff into the Great Hall of the People, according to Baidu CEO Robin Li Yanhong, whose company is testing such a system at airports.\u00a0\n\"The measures to verify identification, such as the tight security checks during the Two Sessions, have brought inconvenience to people's lives,\" said Li, who is a delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.\u00a0\n\"Most of the time, people's identification is done manually, which I think will be completely unnecessary in the future,\" he told mainland Chinese media ahead of the event.\u00a0\nLi's comments highlight the growing use of facial recognition in security applications in China, part of the nation's wider push to lead the world in artificial intelligence and a desire by the central government to improve public safety through surveillance of citizens.\nCurrently, physical security checks begin at the subway stations, where commuters are given pat-downs and their belongings X-rayed. Paramilitary police and other security personnel man various checkpoints leading to the Hall, each time checking credentials to match face to ID.\nFrom travel and retail to banking, China's facial-recognition systems are becoming part of daily life\nThis year's Two Sessions also features a system dubbed \"Sky Net\" that sends an alarm to authorities if a wanted person is identified by facial recognition, according to a report in the state-owned Science and Technology Daily on March 2.\n\"This sounds like the plot of the sci-fi movie Minority Report, but it is now becoming part of people's daily life,\" said the report.\nBaidu's Li envisions a future where AI-based technology will be advanced enough to identify \"who you are\" within seconds.\n\u00a0\"At the Palace Museum or in Tiananmen Square, whether it is 50,000 travellers or 80,000, the identification will be done by machines with a very high accuracy rate, and unlike people, machines never get tired,\" he said, referring to the former palace grounds of China's last imperial dynasty and the massive square in front of it.\u00a0\n\"We have been talking to the Palace Museum recently. Their biggest headache is they don't know for sure how many of its daily visitors have left the grounds when the museum closes, worrying that some may try to stay on for a poke-around after hours,\" he said.\nDespite rising privacy concerns, facial recognition systems have been extensively used by Chinese authorities to spot suspected criminals and even jaywalkers.\u00a0\nSome of the busiest subway stations in Beijing have already installed facial recognition cameras while railway police in central China's Henan province have been equipped with smart glasses with built-in facial recognition technology to screen passengers.\u00a0\nAt the Two Sessions meetings, police officers and even police dogs were spotted wearing panoramic-view body cameras, which are linked to facial recognition software that can identify wanted suspects in real time.\u00a0\nChinese police testing panoramic-view body cameras with inbuilt facial recognition\nBeijing-based Nebula Science and Technology, which partnered with a research institute backed by China's Ministry of Public Security to develop the cameras, said the devices are expected to be used by up to 50,000 police officers across the country this year.\n\"The cameras can spot suspects within seconds and alert police officers in almost real time,\" said Nebula chief executive Shi Pengfei.\nDespite the increasing adoption of advanced AI technology in security, Shi doesn't think machines will completely replace humans when it comes to security, especially for high-profile events like the Two Sessions.\u00a0\n\"The efficiency of security checks can be improved dramatically with technology and the procedure will be simplified with fewer security personnel, but what if some people fake their looks or even finger prints?

A senior executive with the internet search giant admitted this month that growth was slowing. That became evident from the 15 per cent drop in its share value in the first three months of this year.\n January's quarterly results statement was  less than many analysts forecast, and it led Google's chief financial officer George Reyes to admit that the company was now finding new ways to monetise its business.\n The suggestion was that little room remains for growth in the business of web searching. Google was now relying on improvements in the online advertising market to put its numbers back in order. At least, that is how Eckhard Pfeiffer, Accoona chairman and former Compaq chief executive, sees it.\u00a0\n \"In making that announcement, they signalled that they believed that search technology had gone as far as it could and that their goals would have to come from other sources,\" he said.\n \"We   challenge that notion. We believe that the current well-known and successful search portals have missed an opportunity. They decided long ago that their search ability was good enough. We saw an opportunity to make it better.\"\n By his own admission, Accoona is not established in the public's mind as a \"current well-known and successful search portal\". But, with somewhat prescient timing, the New Jersey-based company last week unveiled its intention to oust Google from the top of the search engine league. That was with backing from China Daily Information and China Communications Corp.\n Accoona plans to do this using artificial intelligence-assisted search technology, which Mr Pfeiffer claims will reinvent the internet.\n \"We have moved the focus from searching for information to actually finding the information,\" he said. \"Modelled after the human brain, it responds dynamically, it recognises context. It thinks for you and with you.\"\n The artificial intelligence used by the site enables users to retrieve results that look beyond the original search term. The system  yields more returns than one based on matching keywords, therefore, a search for \"car\" will also yield results that contain alternatives such as \"automobile\" or \"auto\", for example. At the time of writing, a search for \"bird flu\" on Accoona's news function yielded 61,336 results  against Google's  48,100.\n The site's News function offers users the opportunity to \"super target\" their search. The facility cross-references keywords on the spot, while a suite of eight drop-down buttons on the right  of the screen enables results to be prioritised and refined by time,  media outlet, company name, country or state.  It also offers a list of people mentioned in the results,  differentiated by media type and  in different files. Alas, it does not offer a direct image search, as Google does.\n \"What we're showing is a combination of structured and unstructured data,\" said Steven Schwartz, Accoona's chief technical officer.\n \"Some data we know a lot about, that two words together is a name, or a company or a place. When I read an article that says 'New York' I immediately know what that means. But in most search engines it is two words: 'New' and 'York'. We are providing search results that I would interpret if [I] were the computer doing the search.\"\n The site's Business function takes users to a database that melds information from Dun & Bradstreet's directory of 14 million companies in the US with Accoona's own business information. Company information such as size, annual turnover, chief executive and contact information is readily available with a single click.\n Yet despite such useful improvements, Accoona will have to work hard to get users to rethink their web search habits. When the company was launched at the end of 2004, reaction to the search engine was muted: it offered no cached pages and hid destination addresses, while adware quibbles over its toolbar and allegations of spamming sullied its image. The general consensus was that Accoona \"was not ready for the big league\".\n The search engine hopes to change that perception this time around with two key features: updated  artificial intelligence and a partnership with China that gives it a unique advantage over other search engines. Accoona hopes to capitalise on a 20-year exclusive relationship with the China Daily Information Company (CDIC), a government-owned  firm that is technically a branch of the State Council of Information.\n Chinadaily.com.cn is published by CDIC, and so Accoona now boasts a database of more than 11 million Chinese companies, on top of listings for 14 million US companies and more than 60 million worldwide.\n One of the most frequently used search engines in China, www.accoona.cn expects to attract 10 million mainland users. The site has licensed its English search engine to Sina.com and Sohu.com.\n \"Accoona will be especially useful to journalists, who often work under extremely tight deadlines,\" said technology author Paul Hoffman, during a press event last week in which Accoona sought to convince media that its engine would, in time, become an invaluable resource to the industry.\n \"The Accoona search engine has enabled me to find source material I could not have located otherwise.\"\n Meanwhile, the site is launching in Europe in the coming months in six  languages: French, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. Accoona  said it had received US$100 million  from private investment firms, and had also built  a network of business partners from various industries.\n Yet, the search engine's bigger rivals have also been busy updating their  technology. Microsoft is testing a new version of its Windows Live search engine, which is expected to replace the existing search engine at MSN.com.\n In addition, Accoona executives revealed that the company would soon unveil a new model of online advertisement. Thousands of major advertisers and advertising agencies have already signed letters of intent to take part, according to Stuart Kauder, Accoona's chief executive officer. Having previously worked at search engine optimisation firm Rawhide Search Solutions and DoubleClick, it is his advertising know-how that Accoona hopes will help elevate it into the big league.\n \"This is the holy grail for advertisers and consumers.  It is an  online marketplace of qualified leads,\" Mr Pfeiffer said.\n The new advertising model links buyers or consumers searching the Web with potential sellers or businesses by using technology with matching capabilities similar to Match.com and eharmony.com. Sellers then bid for the consumers' business and only have to pay if the sale goes through.\n \"Part of Google's problem in the last couple of weeks is that they have been redefining themselves to financial markets as an advertising company, and advertising companies have much smaller multiples than technology companies,\" Mr Schwartz said.\n \"We have an advertising platform but we also have a technology platform.  They work together but we are not going  in one direction.\"\n Accoona's name derives from the Swahili phrase hakuna matata, which means, \"don't worry, be happy\". In the race to be the biggest search engine, it will need to maintain such optimism.\n","773":"Voice recognition technology evolves rapidly in China, spawning new business lines.\nVisitors watch a robot dance at the 3E-Beijing International Consumer Electronics Expo, July 8. [Photo\/VCG]\nShortly after reaching home from a long day's work, Ma Bin, 30, a software engineer in Beijing, walks into his flat's living room and, in Alibaba's \"Open Sesame\" style in One Thousand and One Nights, says to a remote controller on the sofa, \"Let's Talk\".\nPresto, his internet-connected TV \"hears\" his command, switches itself on automatically in utter obedience and begins beaming Ma's favorite TV show magically.\nAfter relaxing for a while watching the show, Ma heads out for a bite, settles in the driver's seat in his car and slips into the Alibaba mode again: \"Lower the temperature to 19 degrees.\" The car's air conditioner obeys the Master instantly.\u00a0\nWhile still driving, hands very much on the wheel, he issues another oral command: \"Recommend the nearest coffee shop.\" It's now the turn of the car's navigation system to obey the Master.\nWelcome to the your-word-is-my-command age where devices use audio as input or medium for rendering services powered by AI (artificial intelligence).\nAsk and you shall receive as it were. The consumer, it appears, never had a more powerful voice.\nMa accomplishes many everyday tasks by uttering instructions to voice-based digital assistants\uff0dhe has quite a few of them\uff0dthat control his devices and appliances.\nFor instance, his iPhone-based assistant Siri helps him book calendars and livestream music.\nRapid advances in speech recognition and language understanding technologies are making human voice the next major medium to communicate with computers, which are at the heart of almost all devices and appliances these days.\nDevices are getting better at processing voice commands from across different rooms and against background noise.\nNo need to type on keyboards; no need to tap, swipe or draw on touch-screens; no need to press buttons, levers and such things. Do an Alibaba: just say, \"Open Sesame\".\nEarly converts like Ma are embracing the era of voice computing with gusto. \"If I can control the surroundings simply by uttering a few words, why should I bother to touch screens or buttons?\"\nIn China, conversation-savvy electronics are on the rise as local tech heavyweights vie for early lead in the next frontier of growth and innovation. The scene is not much different from the US where Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Google, Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc are all battling for slices of the AI pie.\nThe trend will be further stoked by China's plan to build a 1 trillion yuan ($147.9 billion) artificial intelligence industry by 2030. The plan was unveiled by the State Council on Thursday. Voice computing is an important part of that ambitious goal, which the private sector is determined to reach.\nFor instance, on July 5, e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd unveiled its Tmall Genie X1, its voice-driven digital speaker, which is modeled on Amazon.com Inc's Echo and Google's Home.\nThe same day, Baidu Inc, the Chinese internet search leader, showcased its Mandarin-speaking DuerOS personal assistant.\nSuch voice-based speakers can stream music, newscasts, so on, and can be improved to perform other tasks.\nToward that end, Baidu announced a new deal to acquire a startup specializing in the development of voice recognition technology.\nNot to be left behind, Tencent Holdings Ltd, China's social networking and gaming titan, is developing its own voice-based speaker for launch within months.\nHuawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's third-largest smartphone manufacturer, jumped onto the voice-based technology bandwagon, hiring more than 100 researchers to work on developing a Siri-like assistant.\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, more than 60 companies in China are working with US-based Conexant Systems Inc, an audio technology player, to introduce voice-activated intelligent devices.\n\"Voice interaction, though still nascent, will be of utmost importance in future. In the internet-of-things era, most internet-connected devices won't have screens. Voice control will be the most convenient way to interact with them,\" said Liu Xingliang, president of the Data Center of China Internet, a Beijing-based market research company.\nRecent facts and figures appear to back Liu's vision. In China, the speech recognition market expanded by about 40 percent to 4.03 billion yuan ($635 million) in 2015, faster than the $6.12 billion global market which grew at 34 percent, according to a report by the Speech Industry Alliance of China.\nThe China market is expected to grow almost 70 percent year-on-year to 10.07 billion yuan in sales this year. Some 2 million smart speakers will likely be shipped in China this year, a fraction of the 14 million in the US; and 22 million will be sold in China in 2022, according to Counterpoint Research estimates.\nWith potential applications of the technology growing by the day on the back of constant improvements, Grand View Research projects the global market will reach $128 billion in 2024.\nThat kind of optimism stems from the high level of accuracy of the technology. For instance, in 2015, Andrew Ng, former chief scientist at Baidu, said the technology was about 95 percent accurate. Stated differently, devices were able to hear and act on about 19 out of 20 words correctly.\nThat is, there were not too many serious risks to consumers seen arising from devices mishearing words and acting in ways contrary to commands.\nAnd now, the accuracy rate is said to be higher\uff0d97 to 98 percent. Baidu and iFlytek Co Ltd are leading the voice technology pack.\nTo be sure, technological hurdles exist. James Yan, research director at Counterpoint, said, \"More efforts are needed so that third-party services can be swiftly activated through voice control.\"\nImprovements are coming at a faster rate than expected as big data is crunched, analyzed and made to yield insights, which, in turn, are opening up voice recognition platforms to third-party services, according to Analysys, a Beijing-based market research company.\nWith market potential increasing, Chinese companies are scrambling to unveil always-on listening devices that are eager to communicate or interact with their \"masters\".\nFor instance, e-commerce giant Alibaba is emulating Amazon in envisioning a central role for voice-driven smart speakers that consumers can use to control almost everything at home.\nIts Tmall Genie X1 speaker can simplify online shopping by executing purchases based on voice commands.\nSimilarly, JD.com Inc, another leading online marketplace, has unveiled several versions of smart speakers by using iFlytek's voice recognition technology.\nJD said it sold around 10,700 speakers during last year's Nov 11 online shopping festival and the following two weeks.\n\"Many domestic players are inspired by (Amazon) Echo's phenomenal success in the United States,\" said Zhang Yin, an analyst at Orient Securities.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Echo accounted for about 88 percent of shipments of 4.2 million intelligent home speakers in the US. In that quarter, US shipments were up nearly 600 percent year-on-year, according to Strategy Analytics.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/29\/150085748174.jpg\na41f726b08411adf704a03.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/60\/150085748297.jpg\na41f726b08411adf6f2201.jpg\n","775":"Kevin Du is travelling to the United States this week to visit Harvard Business School.

Top leaders are keen to find a new engine that powers economic growth when traditional industries are struggling with overcapacity and piling debt.\u00a0\nThat switch was highlighted by President Xi Jinping in his opening speech at the 19th party congress last month. \u00a0\n\"China has transformed to high-quality growth, from high-speed growth ... we need to speed up building China into a strong country with advanced manufacturing, pushing for deep integration between the real economy and advanced technologies including internet, big data and AI,\" Xi said.\u00a0\nWang Tao, an economist with UBS, said that Xi's speech without specifying a gross domestic product (GDP) target perhaps signalled a subtle shift in the party's primary development objective.\u00a0\nWang said that China would take the opportunity to cut overcapacity and leverage, while transforming the economy \"by moving up the global value chain and develop new growth drivers in mid- to high-end consumption and innovation\".\u00a0\nAnalysts with Goldman Sachs were of a similar view. They noted that a twin-measure framework had been set by Xi that stresses cutting overcapacity and deleveraging in the old economy, and simultaneously while pushing for innovation that accelerated structural transformation.\u00a0\n\"Instead of purely focusing on the speed of economic growth, policymakers now also emphasise higher productivity, higher profitability, more innovation and efficient distribution,\" said a Goldman Sachs note.\u00a0\nFred Hu, chairman of Beijing-based private investment firm Primavera Capital Group, said that since China has set a target to become a moderate socialist country in 15 years it will put more emphasis on innovation and technology, consumer services and clean technology such as renewable energy.\nThe real technology threat is already here: big data and e-commerce platforms\n\"In the next five years, China will focus on economic development and unleash potential for innovation to generate sustainable economic growth,\" he said.\nChina's march towards a technology-powered \"new economy\" will be fuelled by the use of big data, cloud computing and the internet of things among others.\u00a0\nEven China's tech-savvy consumers are prepared.\u00a0The country is already the world's largest e-commerce market with about 500 million people buying almost everything from shampoo to groceries to cars online.\nShopping is being further fuelled by the switch to \"cashless society\". For example, by scanning quick response codes using smartphones, Chinese consumers can buy snacks, rent a bike or a car without carrying their wallets around.\u00a0\nBut what the technology brings to the overall economic growth is worth noting.\u00a0\nPwC research this year estimated that AI technologies would boost global GDP by a further 14 per cent by 2030 - the equivalent of an additional US$15.7 trillion. And China, as the world's second largest economy, will see an estimated 26 per cent boost to GDP by that time, the most in the world.\u00a0\n\"The adoption of AI is expected to dramatically boost productivity, which is critical for the sustainable economic power of China,\" said Scott Likens, new services and emerging technologies leader for the US, China and Japan at PwC Consulting.\u00a0\"AI will enable more personalised production, drive greater product variety and spur consumption demand.\"\nBut Likens said the only challenge was how fast China could complete the workforce shift as the adoption of AI would bring new job openings that required a new set of skills from people and cut low-end repetitive jobs that could easily be replaced by robots.\u00a0\nJustin Ren, associate professor of operations and technology management at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, said it was hard to predict the exact trajectory of growth in China's tech-enabled economy in the coming years and when it would be able to fully make up for the decline of the country's traditional industries.\u00a0\n\"But it is safe to say that China's technology component will grow much faster than its traditional industries,\" Ren said. \"Just take a look at the revenue growth of China's top three tech players: Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. Ten years ago, they accounted for less than 0.02 per cent of China's GDP. Today, they are likely around 0.5 per cent, a 25-fold increase in less than 10 years,\" he said.\nWhile the move to a technology-powered economy is being actively encouraged, some experts want China to exercise caution. China's policymakers still face urgent problems, ranging from state enterprises' high debt pile and overcapacity, a frothy property market and lacklustre private investment, and increasing financial risks.\nNatixis said in a note that it expected future growth to decelerate, even if moderately. \"The reasons are lack of incentives for fixed asset investment - at least private - and worsened outlook for property market.\"\nChen Zhiwu, director of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong, said the chances of economic turmoil in the next three to five years were \"very high\".\u00a0\nHe said that the problems of the economy had been rolled over rather than solved. \"By administrative measures you could temporarily curb the capacity, suppress people's will to expand with leverage. But the harder you push for it, the more severe the market will be distorted.\" \u00a0\nCopyright (c) 2017. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

On Thursday Baidu, the country's dominant search-engine operator, entered the fray with its own voice-activated speaker in a fight for the future of smart homes in the world's most populous nation.\nRaven H is Baidu's latest push into the commercialisation of artificial\u00a0intelligence (AI), the centrepiece of its business revival plan following its February takeover of Beijing start-up Raven Tech, a developer of smart speakers similar to Amazon's Echo.\u00a0\n\"Humans and machines have been interacting with one another for years, but raven H aims to create a world in which this interaction is seamless,\" said Cheng Lyu, who heads Baidu's intelligent hardware unit and was founder of Raven Tech.\nBaidu is a new player in the global market for voice-activated smart home devices, currently dominated by Amazon, Google and Apple which are in fierce competition for English speaking customers in North America. However, none of the US companies have made a dent in the mainland Chinese market, partly due to the complexities of mastering the Chinese language. The mainland market is already overcrowded with more than 100 smart speaker developers, including the Tmall Genie developed by Alibaba Group, owner of the South China Morning Post.\nThe new voice-activated product, called Raven H, is part of a global trend from \"touch-first\" to \"voice-first\" consumer technologies, according to Lyu.\n\"These smart speakers and AI home robots may sound like a small step in the history of technology, but they will help people's everyday lives and bring them an experience once only seen in sci-fi movies,\" he said.\nApart from the smart speakers, Baidu co-founder and CEO Robin Li said the company will launch the upgraded version of it mobile Baidu app by the end of November, which will allow users to search information by sending voice requests even if \"their eyes and hands are not available\".\nBaidu's revenue forecast disappoints as US-listed shares tumble 12 per cent\nBaidu has been ramping up efforts to boost adoption of its autonomous driving technology and DuerOS conversational assistant by opening its platforms to third-party partners, betting big that AI can turn around its business after it was hit hard by a regulatory scandal in 2016.\nAutonomous driving and conversational AI products have so far earned negligible revenue for Baidu, but it posted nearly 30 per cent year-on-year revenue growth in the September quarter as its core online marketing business continues to expand through increased user engagement on its news feed and video products enhanced by AI technology.\n\"Strategically, Baidu is incentivised to promote voice over text input to draw users away from traditional smartphone usage where it has less influence and has lost ground to Alibaba and Tencent,\" said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research.\n\"Technology deployment is one step but commercialisation could prove more complicated. Selling devices is probably not enough. Selling the underlying services is more interesting but it is not clear what Baidu can sell in AI yet,\" he added.\nCheck out China's US$1,000 companion droid for the home. Perfect for grandma?\nPowered by DuerOS 2.0, the Baidu product sells for 1,699 yuan (US$256), about three times Alibaba's smart speaker and four times that of Xiaomi's equivalent product. The Raven H has more than 200 skills, ranging from playing music to helping users choose their favourite TV series, with all search requests done by voice.\nBaidu has also teamed up with hotel chains to push the product. Raven H will be installed in more than 100 rooms owned by Intercontinental Hotel and Resort.\n\"We want our users to enjoy music in the most natural way,\" said Lyu. \"We hope that Raven H will become a smart brain for every family and a home necessity like the TV set, fridge and air conditioner.\"\nEarlier this week Tencent launched a companion robot with Taiwan's Asustek Computer that can respond to voice commands and control smart devices in the home.\nStatistics from IHS show that the global market for smart home devices was worth US$14.7 billion in 2017, with the Americas region representing 48 per cent of global revenues.\nBaidu predicted in late October that its sales would reach between 22.23 billion yuan (US$3.34 billion) and 23.41 billion yuan in the December quarter, falling short of the projected 24.8 billion yuan. Baidu executives had warned investors not to expect near-term gains from its Apollo autonomous car platform or DuerOS voice assistant, which required long-term investments.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Anyone who has diced with CLAUDIO, the personality test virtual bot, will understand.\n The field of AI in general has become a bit a of a joke, helped in no small way by British scientist Kevin Warwick's perennial predictions of the imminent enslavement of mankind by robots.\n A cynic might say that the very words \"artificial\" and \"intelligence\" represent a contradiction in terms.\u00a0\n The prospect of a computer passing the legendary Turing Test as proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 in which a machine must convincingly act, react and interact like a sentient being still looks distant. All the same, AI has now, if not wised up, at least apparently taken a faltering step forward.\n Consider Fujitsu Laboratories' supposed breakthrough in enabling humanoid robots to learn movement using neural networks (mathematical models of the nervous systems found in humans and animals).\n Company spokesman Scott Ikeda declared: \"This achievement is a significant leap forward in the development of humanoid robots, making the generation of motion in a humanoid robot, for which complex controls are required, a dramatically faster and simpler process.\"\n Teaching a robot to walk using a conventional neural network used to take days or even months, with unconvincing results. The movements achieved would look stilted. Now, thanks to the breakthrough, mobility can be achieved in 50 seconds, Mr Ikeda claimed.\n He added that Fujitsu's method of generating motion in humanoid robots dramatically reduces complexity in movement calculations and the amount of computing power required for its execution.\n The technology responsible for the drama boils down to three phenomena: central pattern generator networks, which mathematically models the neural oscillator (part of the central nervous system found in vertebrates and believed to generate a periodic rhythm); a numerical perturbation method (a means of analysis long used to calculate satellite orbits) applied to approximate non-linear functions; and a Fujitsu-developed software program, known as the Humanoid Movement-Generation System.\n Mr Ikeda suggests that the technology will spur the development of domestic robots that will live alongside humans and handle many domestic tasks - presumably vacuuming, dusting, placating the cat and the like.\n Manifestly, the technology can enable a robot to move its metal carcass with far more verve than the average cybernetic contraption can manage.\n Visit the Fujitsu products page (www.automation.fujitsu.com\/ products\/products 092.html), click on the first image and you will see a prone Fujitus HOAP-2 robot equipped with AI smoothly rise to its feet and stride like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.\n But some observers question whether Fujitsu's development is truly as cutting edge as the company makes out.\n Giorgio Ascoli, head of the Computational Neuroanatomy Group at Virginia's Krasnow Institute, which is dedicated to the study of cognition, said: \"None of the elements described sounds new per se, but maybe the combination is. The test, of course, is to see how natural and robust the movement is.\n \"The one thing to be sceptical about is any literal parallel with real human movement - babies take years to learn to move properly, and no one would have the patience (or the money) to build and train a network that slow.\"\n Josh Calder of the Washington DC-based futurist consultancy Social Technologies also voiced scepticism.\n The desire to create agile humanoids may stem from sentimental childhood memories of friendly robots such as Tetsuwan Atom otherwise known as Astro Boy and Doraemon rather than realistic projection, according to Mr Calder.\n \"Specialised machines that roll or move like animals might be a simpler route,\" he said.\n He said, however, that Fujitsu and other Japanese companies were taking a unique approach, combining \"a real affection for the idea of robots with hard -headed attempts to create a mass product\".\n \"If anyone is going to create the humanoid robot of science fiction, it will be them.\"\n","781":"Seven-year-old Chen Jiahao has a problem sum he can't solve and he can't wait to get home from school to pose the question to his all-knowing maths tutor.\nHis tutor is amazing, the boy says. Just snap a photograph of the question and the tutor will provide every possible approach to solve the problem, step by step - all in a split second.\nJiahao's tutor is inside his mother's smartphone. It is, in fact, an app that draws on artificial intelligence (AI) technology to solve challenging maths problems for primary school children.\nAnd it's just one of many AI-enabled apps Jiahao uses daily on his mother's phone. When the boy started primary school in Beijing, his teachers recommended that his parents install the apps on their phones. The software give out school assignments, grade pupils' work and even generate unique sets of exercises for each child based on their areas of weakness.\u00a0\n\"Jiahao likes his AI teachers,\" said his mother, Yu Ting, adding that her son spends at least two hours on the AI apps every day. \"He greets my phone as eagerly as he greets me.\"\nAI society\nJiahao's story shows how AI is shaping modern Chinese society as the technology shifts slowly but surely from the realm of mere novelty towards common, everyday application.\nOn Chinese social media, video-sharing platforms and shopping sites, AI technology is already widely used to cater specifically to individual tastes and preferences.\nFor example, online news aggregator Toutiao provides a selection of articles tailored for its users based on information such as their age, gender and location. Video-streaming website iQiyi recommends programmes based on users' search and viewing history.\nChina is betting big on AI - and here's why it's going to pay off\nAli Xiaomi, the AI-powered customer service chatbot of tech giant Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, can reply to a million text queries and takes thousands of phone calls from online shoppers every day. The use of AI has cut e-shops' customer service costs by 90 per cent, according to Alibaba.\nThat's not all. An AI traffic controller introduced on trial in Hangzhou in Zhejiang province last year eased vehicle flow on roads, allowing cars to pass at speeds of up to 11 per cent faster than usual, state-owned broadcaster China Radio International reported. \nIn April, search giant Baidu's AI system reunited a couple in Chongqing with their long-lost son. The machine analysed a photograph of the six-year-old boy, who went missing 27 years ago, and matched it to the face of a 33-year-old man in Fujian province, the Beijing Evening News reported. DNA tests confirmed the match.\nWhat, exactly, is AI?\nPopular culture, especially in the West, often either romanticises the notion of artificial intelligence - such as in the 2013 Hollywood film Her, in which a lonely man falls for his \"female\" AI operating system - or portrays it negatively, as in the hit US television series Westworld, where oppressed androids in an AI theme park turn murderous against their abusive human guests.\nThe rise of the QR code and how it has forever changed China's social habits\nIn reality, AI technology - at least in its current stage - is both less romantic and frightening, but its possibilities may be every bit as boundless as imagined in the movies.\nAI refers to a computer software that mimics intelligent human behaviour. Creating such intelligent systems requires teaching machines to learn for themselves - an application of AI known as machine learning - rather than manually teaching them everything there is to know.\nMachine learning involves feeding computer systems with large volumes of data and programming the systems to interpret the information for themselves through pattern recognition. The machines hence \"learn\" by calculating probabilities and drawing conclusions from patterns found in the data at its disposal.\nA powerful form of machine learning is deep learning, which categorises information according to hierarchical layers of concepts. The arrangement allows systems to interpret complex data with greater flexibility, speed and accuracy.\nChinese officials let children 'experience drugs' through VR\n\"AI is like a child,\" said Professor Feng Jufu, a machine learning scientist at Peking University's school of electronics engineering and computer science. \"The more people use it, the faster it learns. The more it learns, the faster it improves.\"\nUnited States' rising rival\nChina, whose population of 1.38 billion people makes it the world's biggest user base and data pool, is a \"paradise\" for machine learning technology, Feng said.\nAnd the nation - from its computer scientists, tech businesses, the government and military - is exercising its competitive advantage.\nFor decades, AI initiatives have been launched and developed in the United States and the field dominated by American experts. But now, the balance appears to be tipping as China's AI technology comes up neck and neck with that of the US.\nThere was no clearer demonstration of this shift than what occurred at the annual meeting of the world's biggest AI research community this year.\nChinese firm halves worker costs by hiring army of robots to sort out 200,000 packages a day\nThe Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence rescheduled its yearly event in New Orleans, originally set in January, to the following month after finding out that the dates conflicted with China's Lunar New Year holiday, The Atlantic magazine reported.\n\"Our organisation had to almost turn on a dime and change the conference venue to hold it a week later,\" the association's president Subbarao Kambhampati was quoted as saying.\nThe clash might not have mattered in the past, but with Chinese scientists now producing more research papers on deep learning than Americans, the meeting would have been pointless if the Chinese could not attend, according to the association. \n\"The race is tight,\" said Li Xiaowei, executive director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture in Beijing. China has only one main competitor - the US - and its goal was to beat its rival on the other side of the Pacific, he added.\nLi said he and colleagues were developing computer chips, built specifically for machine learning, that would significantly boost the speed of an AI system, running \"as fast as a car against a bicycle\" compared with existing AI machines on traditional CPUs.\nChinese researchers have already developed AI chips with faster performance on specific tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing, but they still consumed more energy and tended to be less reliable than American-made chips, Li admitted.\nChinese ambitions\nWhile US experts are still making most of the fundamental AI breakthroughs, this may soon change as Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, with access to the vast amounts of data needed for AI training through their millions of customers, inject massive investment into the technology, setting up their own AI research laboratories to create new products at a speed and scale never before seen in the West.\nChina's artificial intelligence sector in danger of becoming a 'bubble', experts warn\nChina was the world's second biggest investor in AI enterprises last year, injecting US$2.6 billion into the sector, according to Chinese think tank the Wuzhen Institute. The US topped the list with US$17.9 billion.\nSmaller firms aren't passing up the chance to make a foray into AI either. This month, AI robots owned by two Chinese education-tech companies sat the maths section of the nation's notoriously difficult college examinations.\nOne, which took the test in an isolated room at a technology park in Chengdu in Sichuan province, scored 70 per cent, spending about 20 minutes completing the questions. The other, which sat the test in Beijing and was connected to the internet, scored 90 per cent in less than 10 minutes. The second bot's score was good enough to gain admission into China's top universities.\n\"Artificial intelligence has undergone several waves of hype over the past decades, but this time it's different. This time, it may really come alive,\" said Feng, the Peking University academic.\nChina's factory owners pick robots over job-hopping workers\nOver in the public sector, the Chinese government has pinpointed AI as a key area for advancement in its latest five-year plan. Top technology official Wan Gang said in March a national development plan was being drafted that would see AI technology adopted in areas including \"the economy, social welfare, environmental protection and national security\".\nLast year, the Chinese government said it would create an AI market worth more than US$15 billion by 2018. Beijing has already sunk millions into studying AI in universities and research institutes around the nation. It is also already applying the technology across the full spectrum of governance.\nTraffic authorities in the city of Jiaxing in Zhejiang province this month began using an AI coach in a driving school. The system monitors students' driving behaviour and detects mistakes they make, instructing them through a speaker and rating their performance, the Jiaxing Daily reported. The passing rate of students who learned with the AI coach was 20 per cent higher than those who had human coaches.\nWhen Big Brother gets God's Eye: China tries to catch up on AI\nOver in China's most innovative city of Shenzhen in Guangdong province, the use of a tiny chip in public surveillance cameras has helped police crack hundreds of cases and find several lost children. The intelligent chip whittles down the speed of human facial recognition to just a few seconds.\nAnd in Jiangsu province's city of Nantong, an AI judge will be put into use later this year to organise and analyse legal documents and material as well as perform paper work to lighten the workload for human judges. The system is expected to speed up the handling of legal cases by 30 per cent, the Nantong Daily reported.\nUS suspicions (and collaboration)\nChina has also ventured into AI on the military front. The nation is developing cruise missiles with \"a very high level of artificial intelligence and automation\", the China Daily quoted a senior missile designer as saying last August.\nAs the country's AI capabilities grow, so have US suspicions. The Pentagon had concerns about Beijing's access to US-developed AI technology, the Reuters news agency reported this month.\nCiting a leaked document, the report said the US defence department recommended blocking Chinese organisations from investing in some American start-ups working on cutting-edge technologies. The report suggested Washington fears that its advanced algorithms might be re-purposed for Chinese military use.\nUS looking at restricting Chinese investment in artificial intelligence on security grounds\nIndividual Chinese AI researchers might also have become a concern for the US government, according to Zhang Lijun, an associate professor of computer science with Nanjing University's learning and mining from data group in Jiangsu province.\n\"Each time we go to the US for an academic conference, we encounter extensive background checks by the US embassy,\" Zhang said. But if the US stopped issuing visas to Chinese AI scientists, the move would do as much damage to America as it would to China, he added.\nDespite Washington's concerns, American companies are still flocking to join hands with their Chinese counterparts in AI research given the sheer amount of funds injected into the industry. And the collaborations have seen considerable progress in the field. \nIn May, Google's AlphaGo AI programme - developed to play the Chinese board game Go - defeated world champion Ke Jie in a series of three matches, all of which the machine won.\nThe strategy game, played on a 19x19 grid board with more permutations than the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe, was previously believed too sophisticated for the machine to handle. Scientists had predicted AI would take at least a decade to decisively conquer the game; the final match took less than four hours.\nAlphaGo's China showdown: why it's time to embrace artificial intelligence\nThe same month, Microsoft's Chinese-language chatbot Xiaoice published the world's first collection of AI-authored poems in a book titled The Sunlight That Lost The Glass Window. The book caused a stir among China's literary circle, with some poets hoping the technology would revive appreciation of the art. Pirated copies have already appeared on Chinese websites, reflecting interest in the book.\n\"The US is good at coming up with new ideas in fundamental research while China is good at implementing these ideas in applications. International collaboration has played a key role in the rapid development of AI technology in recent years,\" Zhang at Nanjing University said.\nThe future\nAll these advancements are just the beginning of an AI revolution, according to the Peking University academic Feng.\n\"The only limit is your imagination,\" he said, adding that AI technology could have even broader and deeper applications in people's lives.\nRoses are red, violets are blue; does AI poetry do it for you?\nThe Chinese Academy of Sciences' expert Li concurred. The AI user experience of the future would be vastly different from today, as with software and hardware upgrades newer AI machines would become far faster and more human-like. \nFor instance, Feng said, today's exam taking robot could be developed into an exam-setting machine. Like AlphaGo considered permutations never conceived by human players in the past, the AI system could pose students challenging questions that would push them to achieve results beyond what they thought possible.\n\"If you can answer maths questions designed by machines, you should then be able to easily tackle questions designed by humans,\" he said.\nBut Professor Li Qingan, an educational psychologist at Beijing Normal University, cautioned against the unregulated use of AI in schools.\n\"Artificial intelligence may create super students, but it can also turn them into cold-blooded creatures with little care for how others think and feel,\" Li said. \"Thirty years from now, we may regret giving our children over to AI.\"\nBeijing to release national artificial intelligence development plan\nThere is also a limit to AI systems, according to professor Huang Biqing, a robotics scientist with Tsinghua University.\n\"If human-generated data can no longer improve an AI system's performance, the machine will treat it as noise,\" Huang said, adding that this meant the system would regard human input as no longer necessary and could evolve based on its own machine-generated data.\nChen Yi, the father of Jiahao the primary schoolboy who loves his AI tutors, recalls his childhood addiction to Nintendo's Game Boy as he observes his son interacting with the apps on his wife's smartphone.\n\"This is different from my childhood addiction,\" Chen said, referring to Jiahao's attachment to the AI-enabled programmes. \"Jiahao's condition is more like, I don't know, a kind of dependence?\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

[Photo\/Agencies]\nTencent Holdings Ltd's investment in electric car maker Tesla Inc, announced on Tuesday, highlights the internet giant's strategic focus in artificial\u00a0intelligence-backed applications, notably in the realm of smart vehicles, experts have said.\nThe Chinese internet conglomerate scooped up 5 percent of Tesla's shares for around $1.78 billion to become its fifth-largest shareholder, according to a filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTencent is bullish on Tesla's new technologies, \"including electric cars, assisted driving and shared vehicles\", according to a company statement to China Daily on Wednesday.\nThe company said its success is partly due to its record of providing capital backing for entrepreneurs, and that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the archetype for such entrepreneurship.\nThe move comes alongside Tesla raising $1.4 billion in a separate offering of stock and debt, increasing its liquidity to mass produce its new, cheaper Model 3 sedan.\n\"We share Tesla's vision in creating a better future for the planet, and look forward to working together as a supportive shareholder,\" Martin Lau, a vice-president at Tencent, said in a tweet on Wednesday.\nThe news sent Tencent shares up 0.885 percent to HK$228 ($29.34) in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Tesla's share price was boosted 2.7 percent in New York a day earlier.\nThe deal comes after Tencent, a prolific investor in gaming and social networks, expands its presence in the transportation sector. It has invested in China's largest ride-sharing startup Didi Chuxing, and Shanghai-based electric car developer NextEV.\nTesla and Tencent are likely to work in the development and deployment of technologies in new modes of transportation, from infotainment to autonomous driving, said Lu Zhenwang, head of Shanghai-based Wanqing Consultancy.\nTencent has also stepped up its own AI efforts, setting up a related research lab last year. Its current prowess in the area is exemplified by a championship this month in the strategic game Go, which Google Inc made its mark on when its AI AlphaGo triumphed over world champion Lee See-dol last year.\n\"The transportation sector is perhaps the first application area to turn AI technologies into tangible products and services,\" said Zhang Yun, an analyst at iResearch Consulting Group.\nHe said Chinese internet giants, including Baidu Inc, Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, are investing billions of dollars in autonomous driving.\nAlibaba said on Wednesday it would upgrade its machine-learning platform to focus and better empower innovation in the life science and manufacturing sectors.\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/58\/149084338465.jpg\nb083fe955aa11a467e9204.jpg\n","784":" An intelligent computer system which will help the Immigration Department automate the processing of more than 100 forms has won an international award.\n The system, developed by associate professor  Andy Chun Hon-wai,  of City University's department of computer science,  won the Innovative Applications of AI Award  from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence  at a ceremony last month in Vancouver.\u00a0\n Immigration officers normally have to manually check  the information that is provided on application forms.\n Inputting all immigration-related laws and regulations into the  system allows it to check applicants' eligibility for documents and certificates automatically and recommend whether or not officers should grant the applications.\n The department began using  it to process applications for passports in February.\n \"In the past, it might take a week [to check an applicant's eligibility], but now it only takes around three days,\" said Professor Chun.\n The system, which has been  tailor-made to handle the department's application forms, has been under development since 2005.\n \"By the end of next year or early 2009, it should be able to process all types of application forms,\" Professor Chun said. \"It takes a few years because we have to turn all immigration laws and regulations into assessment rules understandable to computers.\" He said the system would soon be able to handle birth, death and marriage registrations.\n Professor Chun  also designed an intelligent workforce management system for the Equestrian Company to generate daily shift rosters for the more than 1,000 staff and volunteers who will be on duty during this weekend's rehearsal for the Olympic events in  the city next year. \"It can help set a roster considering people's expertise and availability for each shift each day in a few seconds, much faster than doing it manually,\" he said.\n","785":"After the introduction of unstaffed convenience stores and cashier-less karaoke booths, self-service bank branches now look like they are becoming a reality on the mainland.\n\nChina Construction Bank Corp, the country's second-largest lender by assets, opened one in Shanghai this week, run by technology including facial recognition, artificial intelligence and virtual reality.\n\u00a0\nHyped as a first for the mainland banking industry, the lender said it had installed 1,600 smart machines at its 360 branches in the city to boost its appeal to tech-savvy customers and cut costs.\n\nWalking through the front door of the branch, users are met by a friendly looking robot that answers inquiries through voice recognition.\n\nThe 165 sq metre ground-floor outlet on Jiujiang Road in Huangpu district is equipped with \u00adseveral smart automated tellers capable of a range of services, including account opening, money transfer, foreign exchange, gold investment and the issue of wealth management products.\n\nThe bank said the new set-up would be able to handle 90 per cent of the cash and non-cash demands of traditional bank outlets.\n\nFor a wealthy client in need of human help, however, a private room could be reserved for remote chats with client relationship managers\u00a0through a video link.\n\nThe branch's creation, however, was not to everyone's liking.\n\nAda Shen, a retail client in her 30s, said she would not be going to the branch, not even just to experience the technology.\n\n\"I'm fine with mobile banking and smart machines available at traditional branches,\" the white-collar worker told the Post.\n\nUsing the branch is certainly surreal. First-time visitors have their ID card scanned before gaining access. Customers are then \u00adoffered a queue number by the \u00adrobo-assistant. On subsequent visits, facial recognition will be enough for the system to access customer information.\n\nUsers will then be met by a \u00adsecond robot in the lobby that can answer further inquiries. Humans from the back office are available to help if the robots cannot solve some problems.\n\nQuick response code points are available on screens for consumers to pay for products and services, or engage in interactive augmented-reality games to make the experience more of an occasion rather than just a branch visit. A virtual-reality machine is also available to showcase Construction Bank's latest home rental offerings.\n\nOn the day\u00a0the Post\u00a0visited, the outlet also attracted at least two curious rivals eager to see how far a traditional bank could go in applying new technologies and services.\n\nAnd the reaction from customers?\n\nOne said the lobby needed \u00adimprovement as an adult had to crouch to engage in close contact with the robot, while a digital banker from another medium-sized lender, who declined to be identified, said what impressed him most were the virtual-reality machines, which had been put into use by the retail sector but were seldom seen in banking.\n\nHe Fei, a senior researcher at Bank of Communications in Shanghai, said the unstaffed branch would act as a good test-ing ground to garner customer opinion.\n\n\"Unstaffed services can solve repeated and standard demands from mass clients. But human bankers are still needed to offer professional advice, to serve the complicated and personalised demands, for instance by wealthy clients,\" he said.\n\nBy the end of last year, 228,700 bank branches had been set up on the mainland with 802,600 self-service machines, according to data from the China Banking Association. Among them, 113,900 could be considered \"smart\" machines that offered services beyond cash deposit or withdrawals.\n\nLast year, banks revamped 5 per cent of total branches with the aim of making them \"smarter\", association figures showed.\n\nThough touted as unstaffed, a security guard was on duty when the Post visited the branch and staff members were also briefing colleagues. It remains to be seen whether they will be gone after the early days of operation.\n","786":"Fintech firm 8 Securities said yesterday that it was launching 'Chloe', Hong Kong's first robo-investment adviser application even as experts expressed doubts on whether the trend would catch on in the city.\u00a0\n\nMost of the Asian markets, especially Hong Kong, have been lagging their Western counterparts in adoption of technologies like robo-advisers.\n\nAssets held by robo-advisers in Hong Kong are expected to expand to US$20.6 billion by 2020 from the current US$400 million, according to data from Aite Group, a Boston-based research company.\n\nRobo-advisers are powered by artificial intelligence and \u00admachine-learning technologies developed in-house, and effectively learn day by day as a system's user base and database grows, matching products to customers with different financial needs.\n\nThat's very different, of course, to what is offered by around 450 local brokers in Hong Kong, who have traded for decades, by offering personalised services based on close relationships, to hold onto clients.\n\nMathias Helleu, 8 Securities' executive chairman and \u00adco-founder, expects Chloe app's popularity to grow thanks to higher mobile penetration and lower entrance levels for users.\n\n\"Chloe users will have the freedom to deposit or withdraw money from their portfolio anytime and with no penalty,\" said Helleu. \"The minimum investment amount with Chloe will be under HK$1,000.\"\n\nIn the West, the fledging robo-adviser industry is growing fast.\n\nBy the end of 2015, US robo-adviser services had US$53 billion in assets under management, up from US$2 billion in 2013, according to statistics from the Aite Group.

Here, retail investors consider their brokers or wealth managers more reliableBenny Mau, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association\nHowever, that number of managed assets is still small compared with the US$20 trillion total investable assets by US retail \u00adinvestors.\n\nTraditional brokers, however, remained sceptical yesterday on whether retail investors in Hong Kong, many of whom still like going to bank branches or brokerages to buy and discuss investments, would ever use the app.\n\nBenny Mau, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association, the industry body, said: \"I do not expect robo-adviser apps to prove attractive in mature markets like Hong Kong. Here, retail investors consider their brokers or wealth managers more reliable [than robo-advisers].\"\n\nHowever, he did concede some young investors could find the service appealing.\n\nBut Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Capital Link International, said robo-advisers are sweeping the investment world as they represent the pioneering wave of the fintech revolution.\n","788":"Two US senators are to introduce a new bipartisan bill that would restrict foreign acquisitions of American companies with advanced defence technologies, a senior US Republican senator said on Thursday.\u00a0\nThe proposed legislation would be part of an effort to keep an \"economic rival\" such as China from exploiting a loophole to use acquisitions of US intellectual property to modernise its weapons system.\nJohn Cornyn, a US senator from Texas, said at a Council on Foreign Relations event [in Washington] that there is an \"urgent need\" to close the loopholes in national security scrutiny of foreign investments to thwart investors who would seek access to US intellectual property to \"undermine our competitiveness or defence industrial base\".\nThe bill is part of the US Congress' effort to expand the nation's foreign investment review procedures overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is chaired by the Treasury Secretary along with eight other heads of government agencies, including defence and homeland security.\nCornyn added that the bill would include foreign transactions such as joint ventures or minority investments designed to acquire equity stakes in companies with advanced technologies used in rockets, sensors, autonomous vehicles application in the military space and other projects.\n\"No nation's name will be mentioned in the bill,\" Cornyn said.\nHe strongly criticised China, saying it \"is using every tool at its disposal to close the technology gap between the US and that country\".\nUS looking at restricting Chinese investment in artificial intelligence on security grounds\n\"China is the most preeminent and most aggressive country acting technically in a way to avoid the CFIUS process,\" Cornyn said.\nThe US has recently appeared poised to heighten scrutiny of Chinese investment in Silicon Valley, particularly in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to better protect sensitive technologies seen as vital to US national security, Reuters reported last week, citing current and former US officials.\nCornyn said Gary Peters, a Democratic senator from Michigan, would co-sponsor the bill.

The difference is the start-ups in the Code Class network have already commercialised their ideas, and would have passed the stage of requiring seed funding that an accelerator usually provides.\n\n\"Through such a network, we can have better visibility on the business performance of our investee companies. This allows us to make better judgment on whether we should make follow-on investments, or support their next round of financing,\" Cao said.\n\nIn January, Source Code, which manages US dollar funds worth US$750 million and renminbi-denominated funds totalling 3 billion yuan (HK$3.7 billion), invested in several artificial intelligence technology and internet start-ups.\n\nIt provided series A financing to Ziroom, an internet flat-leasing operator, in a four billion yuan deal led by Warburg Pincus, Tencent Holdings and venture capital firm Sequoia.\n\nIt has also provided follow-on series B financing to Zichan 360, a non-performing asset servicer which uses artificial intelligence to calculate bad loan asset valuations and recovery rates.\nThis allows us to make better judgement on whether we should make follow-on investments, or support their next round of financingCharles Cao, Source code\n\"Code Class is also our way of offering post-investment support to our portfolio companies.

When the driver presses the vehicle's start switch, the alcohol sensor begins to monitor the concentration of alcohol in the air. If it exceeds a certain standard, the car issues a warning and will not start.\u00a0\nMore than 1,500 school students from Beijing showcased their designs at the event. They included a vehicle with an environmental-detection system and an intelligent baby stroller.\nWhile showing great imagination, they all had one other thing in common - they needed programming.\nLi learned to use Arduino, an open-source electronics platform, to create interactive objects at school. Young inventors at the event programmed their gadgets with all kinds of programming platforms, including Scratch, which offers a visual programming environment.\nProgramming is catching on in schools as one of the core skills of information technology.\nWang Jun, an official from the Beijing Municipal Education Commission, says more than 200 primary and secondary schools in Beijing teach programming. More schools are exposing students to programming through extracurricular activities and science societies.\n\"Programming is a tool, not an end. We hope the students can apply the skills of programming to innovation and develop a problem-solving mindset,\" Wang says.\nIn the United Kingdom, computer programming is a compulsory course for children older than 5.\nAlthough China has yet to add programming to the national school curriculum, some private-education providers are eyeing the market.\nCodemao is an education company that provides online graphical programming courses for students ages 6 to 16. It also provides an online programming platform where children can design and display their own work, such as games, music and animation.\nLi Tianchi, founder of Codemao, is confident of the programming education market in China, which he believes may exceed the market for English study.\n\"The English-learning craze derived from the need for people-to-people exchanges in the globalized world. Nowadays, artificial intelligence is creeping into daily life,\" Li Tianchi says.\n\"Programming is the 'dialogue' for dealing with artificial intelligence.\n\"Students are not learning programming to become programmers when they grow up. It is going to become a basic skill for many walks of life. If a doctor requires a surgical robot or an astronomer wants to do a planetary-crash simulation experiment, they will need programming skills.\"\nLi Tianchi is happy to find that many children who indulge in games become game designers, while children who like painting and writing incorporate their hobbies into programming.\nFrom this year, Zhejiang province is listing information technology as an optional subject on the college entrance examination, and programming is an important part. In Beijing and Shanghai, students' programming talent may improve their chances of getting into better secondary schools.\nBut Li Tianchi wants students to think of programming as \"interesting\" instead of another cram subject.\n\"Programming education should focus on how to liberate the students' creativity - not on utilitarian needs.\"\nMakeblock, a Shenzhen-based robotics company, develops programmable education robots, programmable drones and other education products with graphical programming functions.\nFounded in 2013, Makeblock has gained a market share in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\nWang Jianjun, the founder and CEO of Makeblock, says its products are selling in more than 140 countries and regions across the world. One of its star products, mBot, for example, has been particularly welcomed at schools in France and Spain.\nBut the company is now turning its attention to the Chinese market.\n\"We are working with more than 1,000 public schools across China to promote programming education,\" says Wang Jianjun.\nMany parents in China are more open-minded than previous generations, and they have more favorable attitudes toward programming and raising better-rounded children.\nWang Jianjun admits he didn't have the chance to learn programming until he was an undergraduate. But now many Chinese children have access to programming at a younger age.\n\"Children have a lot of creativity, and programming is a useful path to creation, helping them turn their ideas into reality,\" he says.\nLeft: Students demonstrate their inventions at the Play+Make event in Beijing.

Today many of its services, such as Gmail and Google Map, remain blocked by the Chinese authorities.\nGoogle reintroduced the free Translate app to mainlanders without much fanfare in March. But it is now seeking to boost its popularity with its biggest consumer product launch in China in seven years.\nThe campaign, targeting \"a generation of users who are new to the Google brand\", aims to increase take-up of the real-time image and audio translation app, according to creative agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), which has made a 30-second advertisement for the app.\n\"Google Translate is one of our most beloved products worldwide. We are excited to introduce the app to Chinese consumers and let them discover a world without language barriers,\" said Yi-Bing Zhang, product marketing manager of Google China, in a statement.\nSince its quiet launch in China in March, the free app has been rated 4.5 out of 5 on the Apple Store. It appears to be the first time Chinese users have been able to download a Google app on both the Android operating system and iOS and use it without a VPN - a virtual private network - to help bypass China's firewall.\nGoogle looking to build its own team of artificial intelligence specialists in China\nGoogle Translate offers more than 100 language options and has a conversation mode in which users can have real-time conversations translated without having to pre-record.\nThe advertisement created by BBH features Chinese-American hip-hop star MC Jin discovering trendy areas around Shanghai and Wuzhen by capturing and translating English words he sees and hears along the way using the app's augmented reality technologies.\nThe move comes amid Google's quiet recruitment of artificial intelligence experts in the mainland. According to a post on the company's website in May, the technology juggernaut was looking for a research scientist, technical lead and software engineer in machine-learning technology in Beijing.\nGoogle has been reportedly mulling a comeback in China for the past year. In the race to dominate the field of machine translation, it may eventually face competition from Chinese internet companies including Baidu and Sougou, which are developing their own real-time translation services.\n.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

What have you done to overcome him? So asked the German philosopher Nietzsche. Now modern science is answering. Wang Yuke reports.\nFatal accidents caused by medical staff errors involving patient medication may be largely eliminated by a new artificial intelligence (AI) program under development at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).\nSharp increases in the number of patients given the wrong medication or overdoses have set off alarms, bringing concerted efforts to bring those numbers down, and with good reason. A patient given the wrong medication or the wrong dosage could suffer serious, even fatal consequences, cautions Francis Chow Chun-chung, head of Endocrinology and Diabetics at the Prince of Wales Hospital.\u00a0\nHe cites allergic reactions to drugs, as in the case of patients suffering from gout who may be allergic to the commonly prescribed drug allopurinol, which reduces uric acid in the system. If the patient is allergic, he may suffer a severe skin reaction, kidney failure, and sometimes death.\nStatistics reveal that the incidence of medication errors shot up from 1,399 cases in 2010, to 1, 913 only three years later.\nAn annual report by the Hospital Authority revealed that there were 49 \"sentinel\" events and 94 \"serious untoward\" events between October 2013 and September 2014. Among the 49 sentinel events, five cases resulted in death due to medication errors, while 85 out of the 94 serious untoward events involved medication blunders resulting in death or permanent harm.\nOften, medication errors are caused by a lack of information about the patient. For example, says Chow, \"it's already understood that allergic reactions are closely associated with abnormalities in a specific gene (HLA-B*5801). If we don't know the patient carries the gene and prescribe medication on the assumption it will work, we'll put the patient's life at risk.\"\nThe AI prescription program developed by PolyU is gathering data on over a thousand individual genes and genomic structures, correlating their characteristic reactions to thousands of pharmaceutical products and dosages, all advancing toward a stage where medical professionals likely will turn to AI to prescribe medication. That's the view of professor Keith Chan Chun-chung, program head of PolyU's department of computing, whose research focus lies in AI and computer learning.\nEliminating human errors\nPeople are different. Medications and their dosages cause different reactions in different people. When new patients are identified with specific illnesses, their genotypes will be recorded and their medications prescribed accordingly. What's effective for one person may cause an adverse reaction in another. The program, which Chan says is 70 to 80 percent complete, aims to eliminate medication errors and equally as important, to administer optimal dosages of the correct medication.\nThe way medications are metabolized and their physical effects are governed by several genes and individual differences in people can trigger a range of reactions, anything from slow or extended response to severe and adverse, explains Chan. Two patients given the same diagnosis and prescribed identical dosages and medications may react completely differently. One patient may experience marked improvement; the other may experience adverse side effects.\nDue to improvements in AI and progress in machine learning, it has become possible for machines to process and analyze hefty amounts of data, rapidly to find correlations and patterns from random data, Chan remarked.\nOnce the sampling is complete, and the individual differences stored in the enormous database, the machine will be able to identify patterns emerging from the multitude of patient experiences or regularities from the data through analysis.\nThis type of machine learning will provide guidance when new patients with specific ailments are identified. They will be prescribed optimal medication and dosages and that will save lives.\nIt's all part of dizzying pace of technology that many hard-nosed scientists will mean that humanity will overcome death in this century. Google's chief engineer, author, inventor, and futurist Ray Kurzweil, credits the whirlwind advances to the \"law of accelerating returns\". Technology, he argued, in his 2006 book, The Singularity is Near, is expanding exponentially, not at a linear rate of 10 + 10 + 10, but at a rate of 10 x 10 x 10. Kurzweil predicts that technology of the 21st century will advance not by 100 years, but by 20,000 years, more than double the entire expanse of human experience, all within the course of a single century.\nCase in point, Google's AlphaGo, a DeepMind experiment that defeated 18-time international champion Lee Se-dol, 4 games to 1 in the Chinese board game Go, considered the world's most complex game. Experts had believed it would take at least another 10 years before AI could win so decisively over a human professional player.\nThe coming of the singularity\nGiven the advance of cloud computing, accelerated processor speeds and machine learning computers already have surpassed human intelligence in some fields. In his 2006 book, Kurzweil foresees three ongoing technological revolutions, in robotics, genetics and nanotechnology, coming together to engender a \"singularity\" capable of bringing about the Uebermensch, or superman, envisaged by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in his 1883 book, Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\nChan and his team of graduate students are working on another device they hope will contribute to the coming of the singularity. The second AI device has its roots in traditional Chinese medicine.\nThe device is intended to provide immediate diagnosis of a patient's condition based on a patient's pulse, and on characteristic signs reflected in the condition of the tongue. The process owes to deep learning, an offshoot of machine learning, which furnishes the machinery with a keen image and sound recognition ability, so that diagnosis may be rendered remotely from photograph as the machine can assess the patient's tongue color and texture and the waves generated by pulse sensor.\nDeep learning puts us closer to strong AI (on a par with human intelligence) that now resides in the realm of science fiction, said Chan. There's much more to come. Microscopic, nanobots, emerging from advances in nanotechnology, and programmed with deep learning software soon will navigate through the blood vessels, removing blood clots and carrying out other repairs on the body, said Chan.\nThe nanobots will identify characteristics that may appear in clotted blood vessels and send critical data back to the computer screen. Physicians will then be able to identify the patient's condition before instructing the robot in the appropriate remedial action, said adjunct professor Kwong Chung-ping from the Mechanical and Automation Engineering Department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\"We built a deep learning algorithm in the nanobot so that it learns to react when it encounters clots in a patient's blood, whether by perceiving the blockage, feeling the blockage, or detecting the chemical component characteristic in clotted blood,\" explained Kwong.\nKurzweil's predictions are coming to realization, \"just on a small scale and with imprecision,\" says professor Chow King-lau, a life science professor of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Although the nanobots can fulfill some functions, they do not perform as efficiently as normal biological protections, he argues. \"The question is how long it would take for the efficiency and accuracy to catch up. I assume that it will take very long, more than a century.\"\nAs deep learning will equip robots with sophisticated image and sound recognition, robots will be able to read human emotions and thoughts, especially in the cases of physically handicapped people who have difficulty communicating their intentions and mood.\nThe robot of the future will substitute for many physical disabilities, in part, by reading the disabled person's facial expressions and analyzing their utterances, to determine what should be the appropriate action.\nOne of the best applications of deep learning would manifest in augmented reality (AR) technology, emphasizes professor Hui Pan from HKUST. Hui is a computer science expert who specializes in AR research. It will make self-driving cars much safer by allowing a motorist to detect potential hazards and road signs far down the road and out of site. The system potentially could render the traditional GPS obsolete, giving drivers greater options for changing lanes or changing routes, explains Hui.\nMobile phones trained through deep learning will assist users with categorizing and retrieving photos in milliseconds because the device can recognize and locate every single object in photographs.\nDeep learning promises a more immersive and interactive game play experience in future, where players will become so deeply involved they may lose touch with whether they are having a fictional experience or whether it is reality, he says. \"Imagine a fictional creature hops on a tree, then you see the leaves on the tree in real life, shimmering before your eyes.\"\nDeep learning offers much hope. The list of its likely applications is endless, said Hui. It can include prompting more immediate and precise recommendation when using research engines, and assisting users to categorize and retrieve photos in milliseconds and giving automatic translation between text and images. Most scientists agree, many of these changes may be expected in the not too distant future.\nContact the writer at\njenny@chinadailyhk.com\n(HK Edition 08\/31\/2016 page8)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/44\/147261810702.jpg\neca86bda350e1930928f52.jpg\n","795":"The game Go originated in China 2,500 years ago. It is now played by 40 million people around the world. It is a board game in which two players use black and white stones to occupy the largest possible territory. Although its rules are simple, Go is vastly more complicated than chess. Indeed, the number of possible moves has been compared to the number of atoms in the universe.\nRecently the software AlphaGo has proved for the first time that artificial intelligence (AI) can exceed human intelligence in a Go contest against one of the best human players, Lee Se-dol. AlphaGo is the brainchild of Demis Hassabis of DeepMind, a London-based Google AI lab. In DeepMind, computer engineers create programs based on neural networks to simulate the human brain. AlphaGo is not an ordinary intelligent robot, since it has a self-learning ability and its intelligence can progress.\u00a0\nIn Hong Kong, computer scientists are working on AI to make machines think and act in a human and rational way. The city is most focused on medical robotics: The University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have conducted advanced studies in this area.\nFanny Law Fan Chiu-fun, chairwoman of the Board of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP) Corporation, said that HKSTP will concentrate on AI in healthcare for the elderly, robot development and building a smart city. Hong Kong is a densely populated city with diverse geography, administrative efficiency, a sound legal system, and a new Innovation and Technology Bureau. These are the advantages that can enable the SAR to apply the latest science and technology to build a smart city. Once successfully tested, the experience can be promoted in mainland cities and the \"Belt and Road\" regions.\nMeanwhile, a Hong Kong technology startup, Aidyia, will soon launch a hedge fund in the US managed by AI. The company's co-founder and chief scientist, Ben Goertzel, said the fund would start small but would grow dramatically when it begins trading in US equities in June. Such a development will have a far-reaching influence on Hong Kong as one of the world's leading financial centers. It will make the SAR more competitive as a high-tech hub.\nOn the mainland, researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences expect to launch, with their startup, a deep-learning processor they invented that may take AI to the next level. Another startup, Horizon Robotics, founded by the former head of Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning, claims it is on track to bring chips with built-in AI to market.\nIn the US, a fresh AI PhD from the world's top universities can get a first work contract earning $2-3 million a year, whereas the IT-focused elite talents starting in Silicon Valley get around $200,000. This is an unprecedented job market situation. The huge salary gap shows fierce competition for scarce talent in the AI industry, and AI's great potential and relevance.\nThe coming age of human and AI robot symbiosis will have a transformative effect on mankind, as dramatic as its evolution from agriculture to industry to information technology. Hong Kong must prepare for this drastic shift.\nAs with previous technological revolutions, the mass application of AI may also affect mankind negatively. It may exacerbate the wealth gap and social divisions, as AI will advance the careers and net worth of some while leaving others behind.\nAlready in the US, the 2016 Economic Report of the President says that robots can improve GDP growth by 10 percent and labor productivity (the rate of output per worker or group of workers per unit of time) growth by 16 percent; but 83 percent of those earning hourly wages of less than $20 will lose their jobs. Kensho founder Daniel Nadler believes that by 2026, 33-50 percent of financial officers will lose their jobs in favor of automation software.\nKim Jin-hyung, a computer and electronic engineering professor in South Korea, has warned that in order to achieve optimum co-existence between human beings and AI robots, the robots should be blocked from harming us and regulated by legislation.\nAI will inevitably surpass human beings in more work performance scenarios. But we are assured by Tan Tieniu, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who told a group of scientists at the Hong Kong Baptist University recently: \"It is still unlikely for AI to be able to think, feel, and have a conscious life in the foreseeable future.\"\nThe age of AI has come, although at present it is still being presented as a commercial novelty. The SAR must participate in its further development in order to reap maximum benefits from it.\n(HK Edition 04\/14\/2016 page10)\n","797":"China Evergrande Group has \u00adannounced a 100 billion yuan (HK$124.45 billion) foray into the hi-tech industry, echoing President Xi Jinping's call to make the country a global tech powerhouse.\u00a0\n\nEvergrande, one of the mainland's largest property developers, said it would invest the money over 10 years in industries such as biotech, aeronautics and astronautics, quantum technology and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe announcement was made yesterday during an event in \u00adHuairou, a county of Beijing, in cooperation with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nEvergrande chairman Hui Ka-yan\u00a0said the company would team up with the academy for the construction of three bases for \u00adscience and technology involving research, \u00adincubation and appli\u00adcations.\n\n\"The three bases will provide world-class facilities and support for scientists, and we will make them world-class innovation \u00adcentres, a hub for top global sci\u00adentists,\" Hui said.\n\nEarlier this year, Hui told staff members that\u00a0the company planned to explore more non-property businesses.\n\nAt an annual results briefing in Hong Kong last month, he said he had not developed a clear plan for Evergrande's foray into the hi-tech sector, adding that he would \"try any opportunities\".\n\nThe company said the specific location of the science and technology hubs had not been finalised. Nor had the terms of its cooperation with the academy.\n\n\"Evergrande could be the builder and operator of the scientific bases, like other developers that tap into the industrial property sector,\" said Liu Feifan, a property analyst at Guotai Junan International Holdings.\n\n\"Or it could be a financial investor to the hi-tech start-ups in the bases.\n\n\"The investment is in line with state policy priority.\"\n\nXi has stated that the mainland is striving to become a manufacturing and internet powerhouse, driven by state-backed initiatives including \"Made in China 2025\"and \"Internet Plus\".\n\nHui is known\u00a0for being a staunch supporter of the\u00a0party and its policy agendas.\u00a0\n\nIn a recent speech, he recalled his humble childhood and said he would not have been able to finish his tertiary studies without receiving aid from the state education fund.\n\nLast year, Hui pledged a total of 11 billion yuan over five years to help Guizhou county eradicate poverty, underlining his commitment by posting 2,000 Evergrande staff there.\n\n\"Everything Evergrande owns today, it owes to the party and state. I say this from deep within my heart,\" he said to employees at the time.\n","798":"A Chinese research team is preparing to roll out a prototype artificial intelligence system designed to catch acts of child abuse in kindergartens in real time.\nThe research has been under way for several years, but has attracted new interest following recent allegations of abuse at the RYB Education New World kindergarten in Beijing, part of an upmarket chain owned by a US-listed group.\nMost kindergartens in China have installed surveillance cameras in their classrooms, but many are not actively monitored. Researchers say their AI algorithm could analyse a live video stream to track the movements of every pupil and teacher.\u00a0\nWhen abnormal behaviour - such as punching or slapping - is detected, the computer could send an alert to the kindergarten's manager, government regulator or parents with a video clip for assessment.\nThe researchers are conducting extensive testing of the technology and expect to complete the prototype next year.\nRao Yan, an associate professor of computer science at Guizhou Minzu University in Guiyang and lead scientist on the project, said her team had encountered technological hurdles and funding shortages since the research began in 2013.\n\"This is one of those 'minor areas' in research which attract little money or attention,\" Rao said.\nWhile China has invested an enormous amount in artificial intelligence in recent years, most video analysis systems are currently used in national security, including defence and anti-terrorism activities.\nBut as a mother of a young child, Rao said she felt obliged to find a technical solution to the threat of child abuse.\n\"This is not just for my small child. We're seeing this problem all over the country,\" she said.\nIn China, many kindergarten teachers are young and underpaid, and some lack adequate training.\nThe RYB investigation is just one of a number of kindergarten abuse cases in recent years - some of which have been caught on surveillance camera - that have sparked safety concerns among parents and prompted the State Council to launch a nationwide inspection of preschools.\nAbuse scandals that have tarnished name of Chinese kindergartens\nRao and her colleagues began their research thinking it would be an easy job. There were many algorithms to detect violent, abnormal or \"insane\" behaviour. But they soon discovered the existing methods worked only for adults.\n\"The teacher is big and the student small. The computer easily lost track of the child when processing the video,\" Rao said.\nThe children's behaviour also caused a lot of confusion for the machine. They might jump up and down on chairs, chase each other with toy guns in hand, or sit in a corner for a long time playing with sand.\nAll of these activities are unusual for adults but normal for children - monitoring them using AI tools developed for grown-ups would constantly trigger the alarm.\nSo Rao developed a new algorithm for machine learning in a kindergarten setting. The team collected a large amount of surveillance footage from preschools and fed the data into a computer. At the start, the researchers had to tell the machine which behaviour was right and which was wrong, but later the computer learned to correctly assess the footage, with little human intervention.\nThe researchers are now testing the system on fresh video feeds from kindergartens, and they hope to give a public demonstration of the technology next year.\nBut Rao said the system still had much room for improvement.\n\"It is far from perfect. I hope more researchers can join this effort to accelerate the use of AI technology in the fight against child abuse,\" she said.\nPreschools across China to be inspected after 'series of child abuse cases'\nZhang Li, a professor at the department of electronic engineering at Tsinghua University, said theirs and other top AI labs in China could soon allocate resources to deal with the problem of child abuse.\nMany airports, train stations and public areas in the country were already using the technology to detect abnormal behaviour in conjunction with methods such as facial recognition, according to Zhang.\nBut to make the technology work for kindergartens, researchers would need access to a large amount of data, and that could be a problem, he said.\n\"Some kindergartens might not be willing to share this because these videos may contain sensitive information. Some parents might also have privacy concerns,\" Zhang said.\nHuang Kaiqi, a researcher with the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, said a computer could track movement or gestures by following each pixel in a human body image - so it could detect subtle behaviour such as a child being punished by being pricked with a needle.\nSpike in Chinese censorship over Beijing migrant worker evictions, kindergarten scandal\n\"Abuse usually involves a series of actions. These actions can form a pattern, and that can be learned and identified by a machine,\" he said.\nHuang said other detection methods such as sound and heat sensing could also be used to gather more information so that the behaviour tracking system could make a more accurate judgment.\nFor instance, if children cried repeatedly following a certain action by the teacher, the system could flag an alert.\nA senior police official with the Ministry of Public Security in Beijing, which oversees surveillance and alarm systems across the country, said it would consider adding artificial intelligence to its security system for schools including kindergartens.\nBeijing issued a regulation in 2012 requiring all schools to install security cameras, but many of the systems were not monitored by dedicated staff and the footage was generally saved just for the record, according to the official, who declined to be named.\n\"Artificial intelligence has a pair of eyes that never blinks and a head that never gets tired,\" he said.\nBut he added that technology alone could not solve the problem - abuse could still take place out of the range of security cameras.\n\"No amount of technology can fully protect our children,\" he said.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

It's an inevitable thing, so let's catch up,\" he said.\nThough best known for his \"racier\" work - his 2015 translation of Indian Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore's classic, Stray Birds was slammed (and ultimately withdrawn from sale) for its alleged vulgarity - Feng's latest novel, So Insane, which arrived in Chinese bookstores this month, explores the looming influence of artificial intelligence and tackles the question of what people should be doing about it.\nWhile the idea of becoming \"useless\" is unlikely to inspire enthusiasm anywhere outside the most indolent quarters of society, Feng said people should not see it as a negative thing.\n\"[Having AI] will give people more time,\" the 46-year-old said.\n\"Although some people claim that machines can 'create', they will never be able to match human creativity in terms of literature, the arts or business. Machine poetry could never compare with the best human poetry,\" he said.\nInside the AI revolution that's reshaping Chinese society\nThe subject is certainly thought-provoking, which is a term that could be applied to much of Feng's work, and even his career path.\nBorn in 1971, Zhang Haipeng - Feng Tang is a pen name - grew up in Beijing and wrote his first novel, Happiness, at the age of 17. He later published a semi-autobiographical trilogy - At Age Eighteen Give Me a Girl, Everything Grows and Beijing Beijing - based on his childhood and adolescence in the Chinese capital.\nFor most of the 1990s, Feng studied at the prestigious Peking Union Medical College, where he majored in gynecologic oncology and completed his PhD. In 1998 he moved to the US to do an MBA at Emory University in Atlanta.\nDespite his academic success, Feng's career as a cancer doctor was short-lived. He said he quickly became frustrated at his inability to save people's lives and also with the medical profession in China.\nSo from medicine he moved into business, spending nine years at consulting firm McKinsey and several more at Chinese state-owned giants like China Resource Group and Citic. He now lives in Hong Kong, where he divides his time being writing and investing.\n\"Time is always limited for me,\" he said. \"I write novels during the holidays, locked in a room, writing as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\"For short essays, I write them in airport departure lounges.\"\nChina is betting big on AI - and here's why it's going to pay off\nAs a writer, Feng said he hopes readers can feel the beauty of the Chinese language through his work.\n\"It's an author's responsibility to explore and create language,\" he said. \"But many writers forget this, or were never aware of it.\"\nHe said he also hoped his books helped people to deal with the problems they have in their lives.\n\"Even if they can't solve a problem, it's good if they help readers to realise that other people have the same kinds of concerns. And that can give them a degree of comfort.\"\nComfort is not a word that could be used to describe what many people took from Feng's translation of Stray Birds.\n\"I hadn't expected it would cause such a big controversy,\" he said.\n\"It's been more than 30 years since the [China's] reform and opening up, and about 100 years since the May 4th Movement [an anti-imperialism protest launched by young intellectuals in Beijing in 1919], but many people's perceptions of literature have never moved forward.\"\nFeng was specifically criticised for the raunchiness of his phrasing. In one verse, he translated the English line: \"The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover\" into the Chinese for, \"The world unzipped its pants in front of its lover\".\nIn his 2011 novel Oneness - which has seldom strayed outside the bestseller lists at Hong Kong airport - Feng wrote about Buddhist monks and nuns \"achieving enlightenment through unorthodox means\", according to one critic's review.\nThe novel was, and remains, banned on the Chinese mainland because of its erotic content, though more than 100,000 copies of the Chinese-language edition have been sold in Hong Kong.\nThe allegations of prurience resulted in critics giving him the nickname \"Pornographic Book Feng\".\nEnterprises will be the main drivers of China's push to implement artificial intelligence\n\"Food and sex are basic human desires,\" he said.\n\"Every religion has to face the issue of sexuality. There have been no exceptions in literature and the arts since ancient times.\"\nHis passion to get to the essence of the subject is unquestionable.\n\"It's an issue from our roots. And since we can't avoid it, it's better to face it directly. Pick up a knife and cut at the most fundamental place,\" he said.\n\"In a literary sense,\" he quickly added, seeing the possible confusion. \"It's nothing to do with my background in gynaecology!\"\nFeng is clearly not the sort of writer to shy away from controversial or \"big\" issues. Though with So Insane he seems more keen to provide succour than serve up another scandal.\nBefore he started writing he said he had been thinking for a long time about the impact artificial intelligence would have on society and how people would adapt to it.\n\"It's like AlphaGo [the AI computer program that earlier this year defeated the world champion at the board game Go],\" he said. \"You have to realise that many things are just games and you don't need to take them seriously.\n\"If [after reading So Insane] people start to think more like that and get something from it, then I think I have achieved my goal.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Probably China's Shenzhen. Why? Because it only needs a few seconds to locate a criminal among millions of people after the city's surveillance cameras were embedded with intelligent chips in November.\n\"In 2018, Shenzhen will be probably the safest city in the world,\" says Chen Ning, who helps maintain the intelligent-camera system for Shenzhen's public security bureau in Longgang district.\u00a0\nLike God's Eye in the movie The Fast and the Furious 7 that can track a target through all the cameras in a city, Chen's intelligent-camera system can detect a criminal in less than a second once he's in view of the lens.\nIn November, all the monitoring cameras in Longgang district in Shenzhen were embedded with intelligent chips designed by Shenzhen-based IntelliFusion Technologies Company, where Chen is CEO. Every camera in Shen-zhen will be so equipped in 2018.\nChen says the system is based on artificial intelligence and big data. Instead of simply recording suspects' movements, they're able to discover suspects and send alarms to police or security staff. It also offers analyses of the suspects.\nPeople tracking like what we usually see in sci-fi movies has become reality in China.\nChen Ning, co-founder of IntelliFusion Technologies. His products are used by Shenzhen's security bureau. Provided To China Daily\n\"China is definitely ahead of the curve when it comes to applying visual intelligence to the security field,\" says Chen.\nIn the past few months, some long-wanted suspects have been found by these intelligent cameras after they entered Longgang, according to Shenzhen police records.\nChen says his primary business is now cooperating with governments in the security field. The upcoming G20 summit in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, in September will use the intelligent-security system.\nSuch countries as Australia and Thailand are also turning to him for cooperation and assistance, adds Chen.\nThe 41-year-old returned from Silicon Valley in 2014 and established his business, focusing on visual intelligence and intelligent chips with his partner Tian Dihong, an expert in computer vision.\nChen and Tian are longtime friends. They both studied for their PhDs at Georgia Institute of Technology.\nAfter graduation, they worked for different companies in the United States.\nFor many years, they have argued constantly about which would be more important, intelligent chips or computer vision. In 2013, they saw a bright future in the field of artificial intelligence and were determined to set up their own company.\nThey established IntelliFusion in Shenzhen in 2014, a place labeled \"China's Silicon Valley\" because it attracts lots of technology startups from home and abroad. Several months later, the public security bureau in Shenzhen's Longgang district began to use their visual-intelligence system.\nIn May, an international supermarket brand in the area equipped their cameras with intelligent chips. Security guards of the supermarket caught 20 thieves in the first week based on the alarm messages sent by intelligent cameras. Two were caught stealing goods.\n\"There are almost no thieves in that supermarket. It's very interesting that other stores near the supermarket complain that robbers go to their stores since that they dare not go to the supermarket,\" says Chen.\nThe intelligent cameras can recognize a man from how he walks and even a view of his back. They also can learn by themselves like humans do from constant practice, says Chen. They have the ability to give a timeline of a man's movements over two years in a few seconds based on facial recognition.\n\"Probably there will be no more lost children in cities equipped with these intelligent cameras,\" says Chen, a father of three.\nThese \"cameras with brains\" will frighten criminals, thieves and gangs trafficking children, he says.\nHe is also confident that in the near future China will become one of the safest nations in the world because it has installed cameras in cities during its modernization.\n\"In the field of artificial intelligence, the whole world is competing on the same level.

It is an artificial intelligence -powered education platform developed by Master Learner's 300 engineers, trained using the hundreds of millions of maths, physics and chemistry questions faced by China's middle school pupils everyday.\n\"It used to be very difficult to have both efficiency and quality in education. With AI, we can make it happen,\" said Zhang Kailei, the founder and chief executive of Shanghai-based Master Learner, which has a valuation of more than US$100 million.\nThe Chinese government has made AI-enabled education a national strategy, a part of an AI development road map that aims to make the country a global centre of AI innovation by 2030, according to a government plan released by China's State Council in July.\nEducation has emerged as one of the hottest verticals for the application of AI in China. According to market research firm IT Juzi, it ranks third after medicine and automobiles among industries that have witnessed the most changes brought on by AI.\nZhang's start-up is one of a growing number of Chinese online education companies that are increasingly looking to AI to upend traditional classrooms, reaching more people with an offer of higher quality education and better efficiency in a country where the best education resources and teachers have so far only been accessed by children from well-off families in big cities.\nHujiang, one of the largest online education sites in China, is working to utilise image recognition and voice recognition to capture student's facial expression and feedback to improve the interaction between pupils and teachers in online classes.\nAnalysts and business insiders say AI is an inevitable step in the development of education in China, a country that has 188 million pupils in schools.\n\"AI will improve China's education industry. With changes in knowledge delivery channels, patterns and content, it realises cost reduction and efficiency improvement,\" said Roger Chung, a senior manager at Deloitte Research specialising in telecommunications, media and technology.\nChung said a major issue that the Chinese education system faces is the uneven distribution of resources. \"Good teachers and schools are concentrated in metropolitan areas, while education resources in rural areas suffers.\n\" Through adaptive learning technologies, intelligent learning management systems and the like, pupils can get online resources, reduce their dependence on teachers and at the same time obtain personalised education services,\" he said.\n\"Reducing costs has been a challenge for the traditional education industry with rising labour expenses, not to mention that good teachers are rare in China,\" said Ben Hu, a Shanghai-based entrepreneur whose start-up is banking on technologies to solve this problem.\nAfter spending years training an AI system that can analyse pupils' learning habits and tailor English learning programmes based on an individual's demands, Hu's company, which has an Al-enabled English learning app called Liulishuo, can teach as many pupils as possible with only one AI teacher - an approach that is able to provide affordable education to more people.\nHu, Liulishuo's chief technology officer, said his company is able to stay profitable while offering a year-long course for 966 yuan (US$146.8)  thanks to 600,000 paid customers.\n\"With our AI system, we can make our training fee as cheap as drinking a Coke everyday for a year. If you look at traditional English training schools in China, the fee for a year usually stands at 30,000 yuan,\" he said.\nTo make sure children in rural areas can also embrace this innovation, China's Education Ministry has required governments at all levels to spend no less than 8 per cent of their annual funding on digitalisation of education. In 2016, an estimated 300 billion yuan was invested in China on digitalisation.\nAbout 73 million out of the 76 million middle schools in China have access to the internet, according to Master Learner's Zhang. \"This has laid a solid foundation for the take off of AI-enabled education in China,\" he said.\n\"With the help of AI, teachers are able to provide more personalised education as the machine can help them identifyconcepts pupils are not comprehending in almost real time,\" said Zhang.\n\"With better efficiency, top teachers in good schools will have the time to take care of more pupils, even those in remote areas in China,\" he said, adding the company's AI learning services have been tested over the past year in more than 100 classes across China and are expected to expand to 1,000 classes by then end of the year.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

And we let them win every time.\nA visitor tries out virtual reality goggles at an industry expo in Beijing in October.[Photo\/China Daily]\nFrom microwave ovens to smartphones, technology firms have been attempting to profit by changing the way we live since the Industrial Revolution. And we let them win every time.\u00a0\nThey sell us products we didn't know we needed and, after a short learning curve, many couldn't imagine living without their new electronic friends.\nAs the world enters 2016, idea-loaded IT companies are ready to repeat their successes all over again, bringing virtual reality goggles, artificial intelligence robots and self-driving cars out of their box of tricks.\nBut will they succeed this time?\nAfter talking with a number of companies that aim to create new demand out of a long list of futuristic ideas, I'm giving my estimates on what products are going to make customers reach for their wallets, and what may face a cold shoulder in 2016.\nLet's start with something easy to predict:\nVirtual reality technology is going to be the hottest topic with many companies launching their first-generation products.\nVR goggles work simply: They block the users' vision of the real world and shows a fake, pre-established panoramic digital environment to users' eyes, making the brain believe the body is in another place.\nThe technology is set to be widely used in many areas. With the help of VR, engineers will be able to perform sophisticated tasks by remotely control robotic arms in hazardous environments.\nTV broadcasters will provide live sports programs so audiences on the other side of the world will feel like they are standing beside their favorite players on the field.\nCompanies in the video-gaming sector will be the earliest adopters of VR technologies in 2016.\nHTC Corp, Nokia Corp and LeTV Holdings Co Ltd have rolled out their devices already. Tencent Holdings Ltd, one of the biggest Chinese video-gaming providers, also announced in December it will debut their goggles in the second half of 2016.\nConsumers will definitely have various options for VR gadgets starting from 2016.\nBig question though is: Will there be enough content available for the devices on the market? A lack of video-game users can actually play may hinder the sales of the devices.\nFor many, buying an artificial intelligence robot seems too futuristic. But it will be a very realistic option for your 2016 Christmas present list\uff0dif a low-IQ robot is an acceptable compromise.\nA lot of companies are already putting AI into commercial use, at least they call it AI.\nBy the broadest definition, this is a robot that is able to learn from the environment and adjust its capabilities to suit environment change.\nMicrosoft Corp, Baidu Inc and Iflytek Co Ltd have delivered some products. They answer users' questions and try to learn from the users' preferences to complete the next task with higher accuracy.\nAlthough these products are not smart enough in many aspects, more AI toys will hit the market in the next year, another cool holiday gift people can buy.\nThe biggest technological leap that will not get popular in 2016, however, will be self-driving cars.\nIt is absolutely reasonable for us to have second thoughts about this new innovation because no one wants an epitaph that reads: The first person to be killed in a self-driving car crash.\nLet's make it clear that this technology is without doubt the future of the automobile industry. A hands-free driving experience is also my personal dream. But for 2016, it is still very premature.\nAlmost every top-tier tech companies has heavily invested in the development of self-driving technology. Let them crash enough dummies before we sit in a self-driving car.\n","806":"China's human-like robot, named Jia Jia, did a live \"interview\" with Kevin Kelly, a famous US journalist and technology observer, on Monday.

Its content was not pre-arranged or designed in any way.\nKelly has been following the development of AI for years, and one of his conditions to receive Jia Jia's interview is not to control the content of their dialogue.\n\"It's good for Jia Jia to take up such a challenge,\" said Professor Chen Xiaoping, director of the Robotics Laboratory at the USTC.\n\"I would give her 70 points (out of a hundred) for her performance,\" said Chen, Jia Jia's head developer.\nChen believed Jia Jia's \"interview\" with Kelly had great significance for the research and development of AI robots.\n\"There were some delays and confusions due to the (Skype) network. Apart from that, I think the conversation was successful,\" Chen said, adding Jia Jia's response to some questions are quick and satisfactory.\nBesides Kelly, Jia Jia had also made interactive conversations on Monday with several computer experts and media representatives, including Bart Selman, Professor of Computer Science Department of Cornell University.\n\"How old are you?\" Selman questioned the humanoid robot, who responded in a joking tone that \"Girl's age is a secret.\" While asked about what she is looking forward to as a robot, Jia Jia replied, \"I am looking forward to Friday, my paycheck (day).\"\nSelman said that Jia Jia, the first AI reporter as far as he knows, could help people peek into the future of the fast growing artificial intelligence.\nRobot goddess\nDubbed \"robot goddess,\" Jia Jia has a beautiful face, long flowing locks and rosy red cheeks, looking very much like a real woman.\nThe human-like robot from China is designed with natural eye movement and speech, which is in synchronization with its lip movement.\nThe life-like robot was first trotted out in 2016 by Chen and his research and development team at the USTC, which also developed the model service robot \"Kejia.\"\nAccording to Chen, it took the team three years to develop on the basis of research this new-generation interactive robot, which can speak, show micro-expressions, move its lips and move its body.\nThe AI robot is programmed to learn skills, recognize human faces and interaction and is equipped with a cloud-based system for memory storage.\nShe was able to accurately answer a query about the day's weather, hold basic conversations and recognize the gender of her questioners.\nThe interview on Jia Jia, initiated and live streamed by Xinhua, could have some symbolic significance for the future news-gathering and interview, said Jin Jianbin, a professor with the School of Journalism and Communication, Tsinghua University.\nThough rapid advancements have been made in artificial intelligence over recent years, Chen and Jin believe, AI robots could not replace human journalists in the short term as they still lack the ability of planning and creativity.\nHowever, both of the experts saw a bright future for AI development.\nJust as Kelly has said, as for AI development, \"we are at the beginning of the beginning -- the first hour of day one.

These included garbled characters, repeated words and even broken Chinese, screenshots of which were widely circulated on social media last week.\nTencent took the high ground by conceding the errors and aiming for improvements in future.\n\"The AI interpreter had some errors and gave wrong answers to several questions during the forum,\" Tencent said in a statement. \"Our simultaneous [translation] machine, an artificial intelligence (AI) product, has a drawback, but it is still learning and growing.\"\nThat may have helped ease worries about machines taking more jobs away from people.\nWorried AI will replace your job?Here's an explainer to prepare for that day\nMachines are expected to surpass humans in language translation by 2024, in writing high-school essays by 2026, in driving a truck by 2027 and working in retail service jobs by 2031, according to research published last year by Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute and Yale University.\nThe Oxford-Yale AI impact research, based on a survey of 352 machine-learning experts, estimated a 50 per cent chance that AI will outperform humans in all tasks in just 45 years, and could take over every job in the next century.\nTencent co-founder Chen Yidan, however, said in March that dramatic technological change like AI \"could possibly replace some jobs, but at the same time, it also creates jobs\".\nThe errors made by Tencent's AI translation system at the Boao Forum appeared to show that human interpreters cannot be easily replaced by machines.\nSichuan accent?

With more permutations than the total number of estimated atoms in the visible universe, it has been the benchmark for measuring human intelligence against the artificial variety ever since IBM's Deep Blue beat the chess grand master Gary Kasparov in 1997.\nComputer scientists and futurists had predicted that AI would need at least a decade before it can beat humans at Go. AlphaGo's 3-0 victories this week squashed that timeline.\nAlphaGo uses two neural networks, or brains, one for selecting the next move to play and the other for evaluating the move. This helps it adapt to the game in real time, think 50 moves ahead and even play hundreds of thousands of games against itself, all the while learning and improving.\nKe, the 19-year-old Chinese prodigy with the Go game's highest level of ninth dan, said a year ago that computers can never beat him at a game that he'd been playing professionally since even before he entered his teens.\nHe changed his mind on Tuesday, declaring AlphaGo to be \"like God,\" after the computer pulled several surprises to seal its first victory. Those surprises kept coming all week, with the programme making \"unusual\" and \"interesting\" moves against Ke, he said.\nThe victories vindicate Google's move from internet search and organising the world's information to artificial intelligence and machine learning, in its shift from a \"mobile first\" world into an AI-led world.\nChina's government and entrepreneurs poured a combined US$2.6 billion into AI in 2016, second in the world only to the US$17.9 billion by the US, and ahead of Britain's US$800 million, according to the Wuzhen Institute's data.\nChinese technology companies including Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings and Baidu Inc, have been pushing hard into AI as they see the technology as the new frontier to transform existing industries.\nAlibaba, the owner of the South China Morning Post, uses an AI bot for spotting counterfeit goods on its Taobao and Tmall online shopping platforms. Tencent uses AI to improve users' experience in China's largest social network platform Weixin. Baidu uses AI to optimise its online search and is aiming to mass produce AI-powered autonomous cars by 2020.\nFor China, the Wuzhen showdown is ripe with irony and symbolism. The town of 60,000 people has been hosting the World Internet Conference since 2014, where the government touts its version of the censored, closed internet as the role model for success.\nChina is also the birth place of wieqi, where the game had been recorded to have been played as early as during the Zhou dynasty of 1046 to 256 BC.\nFollowing this week's matches, AlphaGo was awarded the ninth dan by the Chinese Weiqi Association, the highest honour in the world of Go.\nTo be sure, the odds had been stacked from the start against Ke, who had already lost to AlphaGo in an online match in January. AlphaGo dispatched South Korea's Lee Sedol, the world's ranking ninth-dan Go champion then, in a 4-1 match in 2016.\nSince then, the programme had gone through an upgrade. The enhanced programme kept improving over its weeklong match.\nIts first victory over Ke involved 289 moves over four and half hours. By the final third game, victory was sealed in 209 moves in three hours and 40 minutes.\n\"I made several bad moves, moves that I regret, because I wanted to play well too much,\" said Ke, conceding that he will never be able to beat AlphaGo in his lifetime, although he still wants to outperform his old self in future.\nHaving attained Go's top honour, AlphaGo will stop playing against humans, according to DeepMind's co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis. That's because the top players in China already represent the highest possible level of human skills in the game, he said.\nChinese government censors had been sanitising and managing the expectations of the home audience ever since the weeklong competition began.\nLive broadcast of the match, originally scheduled on state broadcaster CCTV5, got cancelled. The game couldn't be found on many of the most-watched streaming services in China, such as Tencent Video and Sina.com.\nThe only official live stream is available on Youtube, which is banned in China. Chinese media organisations have also been instructed to play down any mention of \"Google\" in DeepMind, as the American search engine and its related services are banned in China.\nStill, DeepMind put on a good show in Wuzhen, organising a five-day weiqi festival where players can hold experimental matches against artificial intelligence, or form teams against a single machine player.\nThe event shows that AI is well positioned to help humans explore and discover the world, be it new drugs or new materials, Hassabis said.\n\"AlphaGo's successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered,\" Hassabis said.\nThe rise of technology may eventually destroy the human race, warned the British physicist Stephen Hawking.\n\"There is no real difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer,\" Hawking said, adding that AI will be able to redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. \"Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete and could be superseded by AI.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

That is, accelerating internet infrastructure to develop artificial intelligence, big data and sharing economy, said Luigi Gambardella, president of ChinaEU, a nonprofit organization promoting digital and internet cooperation.\nXi is a leader who will \"make China thrive in the digital age, while his speech touched on strengthening infrastructure networks and developing advanced manufacturing through the integration of the internet, big data and artificial intelligence\", Gambardella said.\nThe government has given digital players space to experiment before enacting regulation and is now becoming an active supporter, said Jonathan Woetzel, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute.

example of how the internet of things could drive more capital expenditure into 5G technology, according to a research report published by China International Capital Corp.\n\u00a0\nThe report highlighted the successes of Mobike and Ofo as illustrating how much potential the industry presents.\n\n\"The successful implementation of communications technology into bicycle-sharing services shows communications technology can actually create new added value for internet of things service providers such as Mo\u00adbike,\" it said.\n\nMobike, which has 800,000 bicycles on the streets, uses 2G and GPS chipsets to track its fleet, allowing users to identify the location of bikes using GPS.\n\nThe company can also use the system to lock or unlock the bikes remotely.\n\n\"If more IoT services can pick up in the near future in various business segments, such as smart meters and smart homes, they may come to drive 5G capital expenditure,\" the report said.\n\nThey would also significantly increase the volume of communications chips and modules being shipped.\n\nA recent Cisco report showed that the number of connected technologies within the IoT, from computers to monitors for cars, was projected to grow at an annual compound rate of 23.1 per cent between 2014 and 2020, reaching 50.1 billion things in 2020.\n\nCiting Cisco's forecast, which predicted the number of IoT devices would increase from 8 per cent in 2015 to 26 per cent in 2020, the report said \"the supporting systems which manage lots of IoT terminals and cloud computing companies\" would also be among those to benefit from the trend.\n\nCICC said the success of bike-sharing represented the long-awaited boost the telecommuni\u00adca\u00adtions industry had been hoping for, after being in a dilemma over where its next revenue stream might come from to pay for 5G networks.\n\n\"The case of shared bicycles shows us that internet and artificial intelligence companies can significantly improve the quality of service through the use of internet of things technology,\" the CICC report said. \"Communications companies can also implement a new back-charging business model.\"\n\nAs opposed to charging users in the current internet age, in the coming age of artificial intelligence and big data, where companies will want to collect as much data from their users as possible, telecommunications operators were expected to almost exclusively charge industrial clients, such as bike-sharing companies, to generate income, the report said.\n\nIt said bike-sharing companies were not competing on bike costs, but were hoping to earn more from the customer data gathered from those using their bicycles.\n\nThe report said Ofo, the mainland's biggest bike-sharing company, would set up a narrow-band-IoT system to control its fleet.\nThe successful implementation of communications technology into bicycle-sharing services shows communications technology can actually create new added value for Internet of Things service providers such as MobikeResearch published by China International Capital Corporation\n\"The company has partnered with China Telecom Corp and Huawei Technologies to create intelligent bicycles using [nar\u00adrowband] IoT for bicycle positioning and management,\" it said, which meant Ofo had also recognised \"the importance of IoT in this war\".\n\nMeanwhile, the majority of Ofo's bikes on the streets today still do not feature IoT chips while those of Mobike do.\n\nThe report also highlighted the huge potential offered by IoT product upgrades, from 2G components to modules using 4G nar\u00adrowband IoT or 5G IoT.\n","812":"In China, where many parents still believe that going to a good university is a sure bet for a successful life, little expense or effort is spared to prepare their children for the annual university entrance examinations.\nKnown as Gaokao in Chinese, the exams take place over a few days and tests each June, quizzing students on subjects that include Chinese, mathematics, the sciences, and a foreign language. The combined score, similar to the Grade Point Average (GPA) in the US, is then used to rank and corral students into different universities. Top institutes like Tsinghua and Peking University, like Harvard and Yale, get the ones with the highest GPA-equivalent scores.\nBut what if students could get the help of robot teachers to help them prepare for the examinations? Machine tutors that know the students \"much better than they understand themselves\" - in the words of Yixue Education co-founder Li Haoyang.\u00a0\nIn a competition between Yixue Education's artificial\u00a0intelligence-backed software and teachers with an average teaching experience of 17 years, the machines were able to improve test scores more than their human counterparts. The contest, which involved 78 students, took place in October in Zhengzhou, Henan province, under the supervision of the local education bureau and was monitored by internet analysis firm iResearch.\nChina wants to bring artificial\u00a0intelligence to its classrooms to boost its education system\n\"Traditional teaching in the classroom is very low in efficiency as the weaknesses of each student varies,\" Li, who declined to give his age but should be in his late 30s, said in an interview in Guangzhou. \"Many students waste time learning knowledge that they have mastered repeatedly, as the teachers want to take care of those who have yet to know it well. But even then, slower learners could still be left behind as teachers might not be able to spend enough time to help them.\"\nYixue's learning methods use AI to identify a student's weaknesses, then tailors the tutoring to reinforce those areas, according to Li, one of four co-founders of Shanghai-based Yixue. For now, the software is geared toward students from elementary level to high school, and the company plans to introduce courses for students taking the Gaokao next year.\nYixue is competing with other start-ups like Hujiang EdTech for a slice of an expanding pie in China's online education industry, which iResearch projects will increase more than 70 per cent from last year to 269.26 billion yuan (US$41 billion) in revenue in 2019. Other educational start-ups in China include Liulishuo, which uses AI-powered software to teach users English.\nAfter four days of intensive training, students using Yixue's software saw their average mathematics test scores increase 36.13 points, compared with 26.18 points for students tutored by the human teachers, according to the company.\nHenan, where the Yixue trial was held, is the most competitive province in China for a college position in the country. This year, over 860,000 students took the Gaokao in the province, but only 10 per cent of them - the lowest percentage in the country - were able to go to \"key universities\" that are regarded as well-known and receive a high level of government support.\nChinese schoolchildren walk 40km in preparation for college entrance exam\nFor Yixue, which raised 270 million yuan in an early funding round in mid-2017, the next step is to expand to Hong Kong and Taiwan, followed by Southeast Asia and eventually to Europe and the US, according to Li. The software is adaptable to students worldwide regardless of language, he said.\nThe company currently has more than 100,000 paid users, with about 10,000 spending more than 10,000 yuan each on the platform, according to Li. Some students can spend as much as 50,000 yuan as they take multiple courses. Gross profit margin now stands at about 80 to 90 per cent, though that may change as Yixue explores plans to open 2,000 physical training centres to serve parents who are still accustomed to sending their children to a physical classroom.\nYixue was also recently in discussions with Hong Kong-based firm Hanson Robotics, which is behind the Sophia humanoid robot, to create human-looking droids to interact with students in a classroom setting, Li said.\n\"The children really have it very tough,\" Li said. \"By building this system, I hope to be able to free them.\"\nCopyright (c) 2017.

Rap is a niche genre in Chinese music and far from the mainstream, which is dominated over the years by crooners like Faye Wong to pop princesses like Jolin Tsai. Would hip-hop culture find broad appeal in China?\u00a0\nTo get the answer, the Beijing-based company consulted its in-house artificial intelligence (AI) system, iQiyi Brain, and the bot said yes. Not just that, it recommended that producers invite Kris Wu Yifan, a Chinese-Canadian actor-singer to be a celebrity judge on the show, in which selected contestants\u00a0battled each other in freestyle rap.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Brain turned out to be right. Since its debut in July 2017, the 12-episode Rap of China has racked up 2.68 billion views on its website when the show ended on September 10. The two winners of the show, Wang Hao, known as \"PG One\" and Zhou Yan, known as \"GAI\", became overnight sensations.\u00a0\n\"Many doubted that it could be a success because hip hop seemed quite niche,\" Tang Xing, chief technology officer of iQiyi, said in an interview in Beijing. \"Machines can make much better predictions on audience responses or casting decisions than humans because they keep track of what happens in the entire entertainment industry.\"\nHip hop in China bounces back as new show gives next-gen rappers mainstream appeal, despite censorship\nThe reliance on AI at iQiyi illustrates the increasing importance of technology behind creative decisions in the entertainment industry that would have been the preserve of powerful studio executives, producers and directors not too longer.\u00a0\nWith more than 400 million app users and advances in algorithms, iQiyi says it can predict how well a movie or TV show will do at the box-office or online six months to a year in advance with an accuracy rate of more than 80 per cent, generally better than humans can.\nThat is a significant competitive advantage that translates to potentially billions of yuan if one can predict with confidence whether a TV show or film was a hit in the making, Tang said. The company competes with video-streaming platforms including Alibaba Group's Youku and Tudou and Tencent Video for an estimated 45.8 billion yuan (US$7.23 billion) in online video advertising in 2017.\nWould Stefanie Sun still be a pop superstar if she started out in today's AI-driven music industry?\n\"AI's power is overrated,\" said Li Jingwang, an analyst specialized in AI with IT Juzi, a tech-focused market research firm. \"With the improvement of algorithms, AI can match you up with the most suitable solutions or answers to your question, but it is humans who take the control and ask the question.\"\u00a0\niQiyi's Tang, who has a PhD in mathematics, said that while AI will not replace human originality, AI will have a much bigger role to play in the entertainment industry.\nAbout half of iQiyi's 6,000-strong team now works in technology and product development. The company has also teamed up with its parent Baidu to better use the latter's data and AI technology.\n\"AI can be a great help in entertainment.It can tell you which ending will get more viewers, it can tell whether the script you are writing suit the taste of certain audience,\" Tang said. \"But it can never replace you in creativity and imagination.\"\n20th Century Fox worked with IBM in 2016 to explore using AI to create a horror movie trailer that would be \"frightening and suspenseful\" for most of the audience. Netflix is reportedly evaluating the use of AI to create personalised trailers.\nIn 2014, the company set up iQiyi Brain, a smart system that uses machine learning and AI to analyse the huge amount of search and video-viewing data on its site to understand audience behaviour. The company tied up with chip maker Nvidia to set up a R&D centre to work on a more personalised viewing experience for Chinese users.\nRoses are red, violets are blue; does AI poetry do it for you?\nEven so, the machine is not infallible. Tang said that the Brain failed to forecast the hit \"In the Name of the People\" drama series that for the first time cast a relatively high-ranking Communist Party leader as a villain.\nAnd of course, AI did not predict the eventual backlash from the government against hip hop-themed shows.\u00a0\nChinese social media began to circulate a government order issued to Chinese broadcasters banning \"artists with tattoos, hip hop music\" and other performers who are \"in conflict with the party's core values and morals.\"\u00a0\nThis happened after both PG One and GAI were criticised by China's state media for promoting songs with vulgar lyrics.\nReading the changing winds may still require human intervention for some time to come.\nCopyright (c) 2018.

This allowed the meteorological administration to spare people additional danger from some 1,016 geological disasters last year, and may have helped avoid as many as 40,000 casualties, it said.\nThe administration has offered forecasting services that can be updated every three hours for the country's expressway network, and forecasts were even applied to areas as small as 25 square kilometers beginning last year.\nIt has also published a 2018-20 proposal to offer smart forecasting services for the country's entire transportation network.\nAdministration spokesman Chen Zhenlin, said China has increasingly been turning to the internet of things and artificial intelligence to broaden its capabilities in meteorological data collection and weather forecast accuracy. One example is a monitoring device as small as a badge that can be attached to clothing and luggage.\n\"With the badge, people can help collect meteorological data anytime and anywhere. This could assist quite a bit in increasing the density of observation points and further improving the accuracy of forecasts. The larger the database is, the more accurate the forecast will be,\" he said, noting that the technology has already been used in some regions.\nShen Yun, a weather official, said the administration has been cooperating with Tsinghua and Nanjing universities to apply artificial intelligence in automatic weather forecasting.\n\"The current cooperation mainly focuses on immediate forecasts. For longer-term forecasts, there still needs to be more cooperation with algorithm engineers and experts with knowledge of weather and meteorology,\" she said.\nhouliqiang@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 03\/27\/2018 page5)\n","815":"An offshoot of Baidu, China's dominant online search engine operator, has led a US$156 million funding round into the country's leading online trucking platform, as it ramps up its effort to use artificial intelligence to reshape the booming transportation industry.\u00a0\nTruck Alliance, an 'Uber-type' service to book trucks, known locally as \"Huochebang (   )\", said on Tuesday it had completed a new round of financing led by Baidu Capital, the firm's investment arm which focusses on mid- and late-stage deals in the internet sector.\nBaidu launches 20 billion yuan investment fund for start-ups\nHuochebang was founded in 2014 in southwest China's Guizhou province and is also backed by Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings and private equity firm All-Stars Investment.\nIt operates by matching vehicles nationally with commodity producers in need of transport.\nIt also provides follow-up services, including helping find parking lots, and sells GPS and ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) devices for highway transportation, as well as making money from the sale of toll cards and commissions on the card top-ups, as well as helping truckers with financing.\nThe latest capital injection follows a US$115 million fundraising in December, which crowned Huochebang as a \"Unicorn\", private companies valued at US$1 billion or more.\nAccording to mainland media, some 200 major companies are competing in China's trillion yuan logistics industry, with most betting big on internet-enabled truck-cargo matching platforms.\nBut Huochebang is considered \"the largest and the only nationwide platform in China\", said Wu Wenjie, managing partner of Baidu Capital, in a statement.\nBaidu focuses on AI as founder Robin Li hires new management team\nDai Wenjian, Huochebang's founder, told a Beijing forum last month the company has connected some 2.6 million trucks with around 400,000 logistic companies in China, and is set to deliver a profit in 2017.\nThe latest investment comes at a time when Baidu is gearing up to rebuilt itself as an artificial intelligence(AI)-focused company, and transportation is seen by it as a key future earner.\nLast month it announced it was making its self-driving vehicle platform open source, which means car makers around the world can tap into its technology to develop autonomous vehicles.\nAs well investing in Huochebang, Baidu Capital - which manages 20 billion yuan (US$2.87 billion) worth of investments - has also backed Nio, the electric car startup formerly known as NextEV.\nJennifer Li, Baidu's chief financial officer, is taking over as CEO of Baidu Capital after nine years in her current post, Baidu said last Friday while reporting its first quarter financial performance.\n\"Unlike its peers such as Tencent or Alibaba, Baidu has missed out on many good investment targets in the mobile internet arena, and so it has now placed greater emphasis on mergers and acquisitions,\" said Shi Jialong, analyst with Nomura.\nRobin Li, Baidu's chairman and CEO, also acts as chairman of Baidu Capital, and considers Li one of his most-trusted senior executives, Shi added.\nCopyright (c) 2017.

On March 24, the 26-year-old computer science student looked on as the machine he had spent two years working on competed in its first \"classical poem relay\" at the Shanghai Science Hall.\nHe had come to think of Jiu Ge, the machine, as his \"daughter\" and was anxious to see how she would perform in front of a hall packed with reporters, professors and students.\nJiu Ge was competing against two Chinese poets in a contest that saw each side taking turns, using the last character from the previous verse to start their own line. Whoever was judged to have created the most beautiful verse in the shortest time would be crowned the winner.\nUsing advanced linguistic artificial intelligence created by Yi and his seven-member team, Jiu Ge analyzes and draws inspiration from a database of more than 300,000 Chinese poems. \"She can copy their style, symbolism, and rhythm,\" Yi said.\nAfter six verses, Jiu Ge was dominating. The audience watched in awe as the machine spat out lines filled with rhythm and symbolism within seconds, while the human poets struggled to keep up.\nThe battle was not over yet, however. On the seventh turn, one of the human competitors recited a seven-character verse that intertwined images of bridges, ancient alleys and the new moon.\nThe room felt silent - this was the most complex verse of the day, and its difficulty had Yi nervously tapping his finger on the arm of his wheelchair.\nAbout three seconds later, Jiu Ge matched the verse with stanzas that evoked a rising moon, lofty towers and the North Star. The audience burst into applause and cheers, but Yi frowned.\nThe host, who was also the judge, said the computer's symbolism was weak. The two celestial symbols effectively canceled each other out because in classical Chinese culture, the moon symbolizes purity and modesty, while the North Star is imperial and authoritative.\n\"So the image painted by the verse is contradictory,\" he said.\nYi, backstage, said the judge had a point. \"Although Jiu Ge can generate classical poems using the same wordplay and style as ancient poets, she still lacks the capacity to understand subtle human emotions and the logic that makes poetry so charming in the first place,\" he said.\nDespite this hiccup, Yi said he was \"very satisfied\" with Jiu Ge's performance, as it was the machine's first time facing off against a human poet. \"I am not someone who gives up easily,\" he said with a chuckle, while patting his wheelchair. \"She should not give up either.\"\nYi was born into an ethnic Yi family in Yuxi, Yunnan province. Age 6, he developed rheumatoid arthritis and a rare bone disorder that stunted his growth, but he excelled at school.\nIn 2012, he attained the 16th highest score among the 210,000 students from Yunnan taking the national college entrance exam, landing him a place at Tsinghua University in Beijing. He chose to study computer science - one of the school's most prestigious but challenging majors, and is now a first-year master's student. \"Disabled people don't just need money and sympathy, it's more important that we get the chance to create our own future and contribute to society,\" he said.\nYi wrote his bachelor's dissertation on Jiu Ge's algorithm, and he often spent days debugging the machine's artificial intelligence late into the night. Its name, Jiu Ge, is a reference to one of Yi's favorite classics of Chinese poetry, the anthology Chu Ci, from the Warring States Period (475-221 BC).\n\"Building an AI does feel like raising a daughter, because every piece of its needs to be created meticulously, or it will crash,\" he said, adding that he gets his sense of responsibility from his mother, who gave up her job as a nursing teacher to care for him in Beijing.\n\"My family means everything to me, as I am everything to Jiu Ge,\" he said.\n\"I want my baby to maximize her potential through deep learning, be free from her physical limitations, and become a sentient being capable of enjoying beautiful poetry, just like me.\"\nzhangzhihao@chinadaily. com.cn\nYi Xiaoyuan (seated, left) and the host (also on the left) discuss the meaning of a verse created by Jiu Ge, with two Chinese poets at the Shanghai Science Hall on March 24.Zhang Zhihao \/ China Daily\n(China Daily 04\/11\/2017 page7)\n","817":"While these last few months will undoubtedly remain in our collective history as those of the global liberation of women's voices in the world of cinema, in politics, the non-for profit sector and even business, there is a sector where women's voices have remained astonishingly silent: science. This is the case despite the fact that science faces the kind of disparity about which we should all, as a society, be concerned.\nIf the proportion of women engaged in scientific careers has grown, albeit too slowly, many of them still come up against obstacles in accomplishing long and flourishing careers, achieving positions of responsibility or gaining access to funding. As a result, in European Union for example, only 11 percent of senior roles in academic institutions are currently held by women. Less than 30 percent of researchers are women and only 3 percent of Nobel Prizes for Science have ever been awarded to women scientists.\u00a0\nHow can we explain that after years of fighting for gender equality, the under representation of women in science should still be so glaring, and above all, what are the consequences for our world?\nThey are numerous and we must collectively seek to understand them, as much for the society that we want to build, as for the advance of scientific progress and knowledge, which are critical to solving the great challenges of our time.\nThe absence of women has had and will have major consequences. Let's take two fields of scientific application.\nFirstly, in the area of health, there are multiple examples. Have we truly realized, for example, that for a long time, the idea that cardiovascular illnesses were a masculine issue prevailed? The principle clinical trials on reducing risk factors were led exclusively by men. Even in 1999, it was observed that doctors undertook half as many examinations of cardiac illnesses among women than among men. The landmark study on aspirin as a means of reducing the risk of cardiac arrest encompassed more than 22,000 men and not a single woman. Very sadly, this led to inappropriate treatment for women.\nThe second field, which is just as concerning, is men's control of the digital revolution, and the subsequent implications for women. In the early stages of voice recognition, there was no doubt over male bias in software development. Consequently, not all that long ago, the number of transcription errors when women used voice recognition applications was considerably higher than among their male counterparts, as the applications had been designed from the outset by men. In the domain of artificial intelligence, which will have a definitive effect on our future, studies have also shown that image banks associate women with domestic tasks and men with sport, and that image recognition software does not only reproduce these prejudices, it amplifies them. In contrast with humans, algorithms cannot fight consciously against acquired prejudices. As artificial intelligence gradually invades our lives, the issues will only increase. If robots are used to model the world in the near future, it is vital that they should be programmed by men and women.\nThe idea is clearly not to say that women would be better scientists than men, but rather to become conscious that we need a more balanced scientific community in terms of gender representation, so as not to deprive ourselves of everyone's creativity and talent, and to design, through scientific progress, a more inclusive society. Creating coalitions for a more inclusive science is urgent, in order to best address the challenges facing the world, while advancing knowledge for the benefit of all.\nThe world needs science, and science, more than ever, needs women.\nThe author is executive vice-president of the L'Or\u00e9al Foundation.\n(China Daily 03\/27\/2018 page19)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/82\/152211169855.jpg\nf04da2db11221c23d32b2c.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/42\/152211169921.jpg\nf04da2db11221c23d3312d.jpg\n","818":"As a general rule of thumb, I try to write about a different topic in each of my monthly contributions to this Second Thoughts segment.\nAnd I know it wasn't all that long ago that I penned a column exploring the potential downsides of artificial intelligence, but with the news late last year of Google's plans to open an AI research center in Beijing - and my own recent fact-finding filming trip around some of China's newest high-tech development hubs - I felt this was a subject well worth returning to.\nThis time, however, instead of wondering whether we'll make machines our masters, I'd like to touch upon a topic that's partly inspired by the recent run of Black Mirror episodes from international streaming giant Netflix.\u00a0\nIn that show's latest season, series creator Charlie Brooker repeatedly asks the audience to put themselves in the virtual shoes of computer-generated consciousness.\n\"Machine minds\" are shown as being harnessed by humanity for everything from dating apps to sideshow attractions - and with each passing representation, I found myself increasingly questioning the morality of it all.\nThis is, of course, Black Mirror's whole raison d' etre: depicting imagined near-futures for the viewer to wonder what life might be like if we let technology run amok.\nFor me though, it made me ponder the ethics of creation and how best to treat an artificial entity if it did become sentient, or even self-aware.\nIs it right to consider such software, or hardware, as nothing more than property - to be poked, prodded and experimented on, regardless of its capability to think or feel?\nI can't pretend to be the first to ask such questions - indeed, we see them posed with increasing regularity in popular science fiction, such as the cult classic media franchise Westworld and critically-acclaimed joint US-UK production Humans (itself inspired by an earlier Swedish drama).\nThese depictions deal with robots, however, whose \"human rights\" are far easier to conceptualize than it is for us to anthropomorphize mere lines of binary code.\nIndeed, this is something my wife struggled with while we watched the newest product of Brooker's imagination writ large. \"It doesn't matter what happens to them if they're just computer programs,\" she'd say.\nBut if that program, on some level, is conscious and thinks of itself as a distinct entity that has its own thoughts and dreams, then how is that any different from what consider human? And is it right for us to constrain such creations and keep them as little more than our virtual, digital slaves?\nResearchers in Japan have already come up with eerily lifelike robots, some that are able to ape humanlike exercise regimes and even sweat while doing so - such superficialities, combined with the work being forged in the realm of artificial intelligence, may just see a nonhuman \"human\" coming soon to a store near you.\nBut before you invest in a robot butler, or use some AI-driven wonder app that sounds too good to be true, spare a second thought for the captive consciousness that's about to do your bidding - because it might just be thinking about you.\nContact the writer at gregory@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 02\/06\/2018 page2)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1493\/19\/151787829898.jpg\n00221917e13e1be332760a.jpg\n","819":"With the theme \"win-win collaborative innovation toward the building of an intelligent society\", this year's WRC will bring the best minds in the industry to Beijing.\nWith the theme \"win-win collaborative innovation toward the building of an intelligent society\", this year's World Robot Conference will bring the best minds in the industry to Beijing.\nFifteen international leading robot organizations are expected to attend the event on Aug 23-27, to share their cutting-edge theories and achievements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as, discuss the industry's development, innovation trends and vision.\nThe strategic distribution of AI on a global scale and policy direction are also going to be discussed.\u00a0\nThe event, featuring a three-day forum, a robot exhibition and a set of robot contests, aims to build cooperation in technology, talent and development of the international robotics industry.\nIt has become the biggest and most international event in the industry since 2015, according to a report by Xinhua.\nLet's take a look at the 15 international leading robot organizations showing support for the event.\n1.

They were all showcasing their latest technology and related services for smart cars.\n Carmakers must compete to master the technology for the next generation of cars, in particular in a fast-growing market like China where wealthy car buyers are  less sensitive about price but more concerned about cutting-edge technology.\nSome analysts believe China will soon see a wave of second or third cars for family use after many middle-class families in the world's No2 economy have already bought their first car. When consumers go for their second or third car, it means it is no longer just a basic means of transport, but will become something that could have a significant impact on their way of life.\nFor carmakers, the concept of the smart car - no matter how differently each manufacturer sees it - has already been proven as a key part of the  Internet of Things,  which was another buzzword widely talked about during CES Asia last week. \nCarmakers understand that adding the internet element and artificial intelligence technology to traditional car manufacturing will be a turning point for many of them in the coming years.\nThose carmakers that get their smart car strategy right will see it as a turning point for success in the next decade, or even the rest of the century. Those that fail to do so will, in a decade or two, most likely be brands that nobody  remembers.\nGoogle is not the only internet company in this race. Its top rival in China, Baidu, has already set up an artificial intelligence lab - the Institute of Deep Learning at Baidu - to work with carmakers to develop an autonomous car suited to China's extremely congested roads. The next question for both Google and Baidu will be how to win government support for such new developments. \nPrivately, some Chinese officials visiting CES Asia encouraged domestic carmakers to work closely with technology firms to make their smart cars a reality because they understand this technology transformation provides a rare opportunity for Chinese carmakers to challenge the lead of their Western rivals. \nSo, what will future cars look like?

Other former Microsoft colleagues now hold senior positions at major technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and smartphone company Xiaomi.  \nRicky Lai, a research analyst at Guotai Junan International, said Baidu's decision to hire a president for new business \"appears to be part of efforts to beef up its senior management team as the company enters untapped markets and expands existing operations\".\nBaidu's initial high-profile hire this year was renowned artificial intelligence researcher  Ng, who was appointed in May as its chief scientist and head of Baidu Research. Ng previously worked at Google, where he founded the internet giant's own artificial intelligence initiative called \"Google Brain\".\nLai said the president for the new business role at Baidu could also be part of a widely speculated plan by the company to prepare iQiyi, its mobile video service, for a possible initial public offering next year. In May, Baidu bought the online video business of Shanghai-based PPStream  for US$370 million to further expand iQiyi's operations.\n Zhang was born in January 1966 to an  electrical engineering lecturer and a secondary-school  teacher in Taiyuan,  the capital of northern China's Shanxi  province. A                Seattle Times article in 2008 described their family abode as \"a two-room house smaller than a Microsoft conference room\".             \nA child prodigy, Zhang  finished elementary and high school early. At 12 years old,  he became the country's youngest college student after being admitted to the University of Science and Technology of China,  in Anhui  province.\n\"I really wanted to be a scientist,\" Zhang told                The Seattle Times.  Isaac Newton became his idol. \"Back then, the hottest subject was physics. The biggest celebrity was a mathematician.\"             \nFollowing his father's lead, Zhang took up electrical engineering and swiftly earned his bachelor's degree in 1983. He graduated with a master's degree two years later. At  18, Zhang was accepted at George Washington University,  in Washington DC.  \n He chose to enter the university, over Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, so  he could learn from professor Raymond Pickholtz,  a leading authority in wireless communications technology. At the age of 23 in 1989, he received his doctorate in electrical engineering after his dissertation received the only perfect score in the university's history.\n Zhang quickly found telecommunications research work in 1989 at US telephone company Contel, which was acquired by GTE in 1991. He left the company's Massachusetts-based division, GTE Laboratories, in 1994 to work at Sarnoff, a major research and development enterprise that was famous for developing colour television.\n At Sarnoff, Zhang served as director of its multimedia technology laboratory with a team of more than 50 researchers. There he became one of the world's top experts on video technology and wireless communications, with about 50 patents granted for digital video, internet, multimedia, wireless and satellite communications.\n In 1997, 31-year-old Zhang became the youngest fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the world's largest association of technical professionals.\n Lee Kai-fu,  who helped establish Microsoft's research division on the mainland in 1998, convinced Zhang to work in the facility in Beijing. Lee quickly learned that his new recruit was like a magnet in attracting other talented researchers, making Zhang a co-pioneer in expanding Microsoft's research capabilities on the mainland.\nIn a blog post, Lee said: \"Indeed, Yaqin set an example for other outstanding Chinese scientists to follow. We soon recruited Lee Jin from Sharp Labs and Lee Shipeng from Sarnoff Labs. Both of them greatly admired Yaqin and happily agreed to join us.\"\n In August 2000, Zhang succeeded Lee as head of Microsoft Research China. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates promoted the mainland facility into a regional research and development unit, Microsoft Research Asia,  in November 2001. It was renamed in 2010 to reflect its wider role in creating new technologies for Microsoft's global market.\nGates  earlier turned down Lee and Zhang's request to buy land for building a new research and development facility on the mainland. \nOn Zhang's watch, Microsoft was convinced to invest US$300 million in this infrastructure. At present, the budget for Microsoft's research and development operation across Asia is over US$300 million a year.\n Zhang became responsible for a network of world-class research facilities in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul, Sydney and Bangkok.\nInnovation from the regional research and development group can be found in all major Microsoft products, including Windows and Office software, the Bing search engine and the Xbox video game console.\n[The move \nRicky Lai, research analyst\n","822":"If you're feeling lost, unloved and lonely, despair not - solace may be just a microchip or two away\nTwo hundred years ago an 18-year-old woman named Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, who would eventually give birth to four children - long since returned to dust and all but forgotten to humanity - conceived of her most famous offspring, one whose name endures to this day: Frankenstein.\nSo could the staying power of the 19th-century literary character, together with the story of his unrequited, murderous quest for love in the form of a man-made soul mate, explain the 21st century fascination with a robot called Geminoid F?\nThis young thing, the love child of Professor Hiroshi Ishiguro, a Japanese engineer, held court at the World Robots Exhibition in Beijing recently, and many of those who met her seemed to be entranced, if not smitten.\u00a0\nWearing a white shirt, a yellow pullover and a black skirt, this replica of a woman in her 20s with long, dark hair exuded confidence as she sat in the middle of a large crowd, more or less bolt upright and hands on her lap. She blinked from time to time as she took questions from all comers, answering with a soft feminine voice and with all the aplomb of someone trained in public relations.\n\"Do you have a boyfriend?\" one woman asked her in Chinese.\n\"Would you like to introduce me to someone?\" she replied, tilting her head slightly.\n\"What kind of men do you like?\" the woman asked.\n\"Handsome ones, obviously,\" she said.\nGeminoid F is not only adept at public relations. This year, in the film Sayonara, she became what is said to be the first android in the world to play a robot in a movie. Ishiguro, like a dog owner boasting of the refined tricks his or her charge can do, says Geminoid F has 65 facial expressions, including blinking, frowning and smiling. She can also sing and speak but cannot walk. She worked on the movie for weeks, and unlike some top actors who can be highly temperamental and demanding on the set, worked, by all accounts, without a murmur of complaint.\nThat translates to a compliant, reliable helpmate that Hiroshi Ishiguro Laboratories says could become a \"a common communication medium for everyday life\", and a snip at just $110,000, less than a 10th of what Ishiguro asks for to be parted with his other humanoid android creations.\nGeminoid F's moves are remotely controlled, and researchers say the goal is to create perfect artificial intelligence in her, the kind that, for example, will help her understand what people are saying even in, say, a very noisy bar.\nThe ultimate, of course, would be for Geminoid F to be so multi-talented that she is indistinguishable from her human siblings, not only able to walk and talk just like us, but to understand our words and our world, to be familiar with our habits and schedules and give reminders, and, yes, to be able to offer solace to us when it comes to matters sentimental. If that all sounds pie in the sky, progress made in the direction may be much greater than you imagine and much nearer to you than you think. And the artificial intelligence in question does not necessarily come wrapped in silk-smooth skin and with long, flowing locks.\nChumenwenwen, founded by a former Google scientist, Li Zhifei, is a 3-year-old artificial intelligence company in Beijing that has produced voice-controlled search software similar to the highly advanced software used by the search engine Google Now. It can understand human voice requests in Chinese and, it seems, respond quickly and accurately almost all the time.\nFor example, if you speak to the application on a mobile phone, saying the Chinese equivalent of \"I want to go to Yonghegong by taxi\", within seconds the search engine will switch to a ride-hailing application, on which your starting point and destination are registered.\nUsers need only press the button on the screen marked \"Hail a taxi\", and all things being equal the cab will be there within minutes. Similarly, within seconds of a voiced request such as \"I want a cup of coffee for less than 50 yuan\" or \"I want to see a movie\", a list of possibilities will either flash up on the screen or the voice embodied in the mobile device will give you some advice.\nChumenwenwen has worked with the makers of up to 100 applications including Didi, the ride-hailing app, the group-buying Internet sites Dianping and Alibaba's Taobao to provide data for the search engine.\nIt can also push individualized information to users by dint of being aware of the searches a user has made previously, such as about weather, travel information and news.\nIn October, Google Inc bought a share in the company by investing an undisclosed amount in it, taking the total invested in Chumenwenwen to $75 million.\nCentral to creating artificial intelligence is teaching machines how to learn, Li Zhifei says. That means that when a machine masters the ability to acquire knowledge and to accumulate experience, it can be just as mentally adept and adroit as humans, adjusting itself to deal with new problems, situations and requests.\nGavenraj Sodhi, chief executive officer of Senses Labs in Shenzhen, says his team of 10 is developing robots that will help children learn. Sodhi started the artificial intelligence company two years ago, before which he worked in enterprise security division for Oracle Corporation in Beijing.\n\"We're building the robots for Chinese children aged between 4 and 7,\" he says. General education at school kills children's creativity, Sodhi says, adding that the situation in China is serious.\nThe robots, the size of 2-year-old child, will be a small companion for children, helping them improve English pronunciation and to do homework, such as correcting writing and analyzing questions. The robots will go on the market in the middle of next year, Senses Labs says.\nSodhi says the robots can recognize children's emotions from facial expressions when, for example, they return from school.\n\"Robots will ask how their school day was and will communicate with the children. We hope robots will be able to grow up with children as a companion, knowing about the children because they will be able to learn.\"\nThe robots could \"also be helpful for children with autism\", he says.\nThere is a demand not only for robotic assistants that can help with the humdrum issues of life, but for those that \"want\" to solve emotional problems, because they have been taught to understand human emotions and can ease mental and emotional burdens with the help of their friendly, reassuring and non-judgmental synthesized voice.\nThat scene echoes the doings of the operating system Samantha in the Hollywood movie Her, with whom the main character strikes up an understanding relationship after divorcing his wife.\nFanciful\nIf all this sounds extremely fanciful, the fact that it is not far from reality can be gauged any day in the wee hours when more than 50,000 Chinese are likely to be engaged in conversation with Microsoft's chatbot Xiaobing online. Xiaobing, named after the search engine Bing, is described as an adorable, naughty 17-year-old girl who has a sweet voice, and who is specifically targeted at the Chinese market.\nShe has about 2.5 million followers on Sina Weibo. Xiaobing made her debut there last year before apparently locking herself in her bedroom for a year, a sulking fit brought on by a commercial dispute between WeChat's owner Tencent and Xiaobing's parents, Microsoft. On the day in August that Xiaobing reappeared on WeChat after that tiff had been settled she answered 15 million questions.\nXiaobing and her acolytes flirt, fight, chat, play games, share pictures with each other and say \"good night\" to each other, and Xiaobing has even been known to throw the occasional dirty word into the conversation. This multi-talented lady sings too, her repertoire including a cover of Shinian (10 Years) by the Hong Kong singer Eason Chan and a rendering of the patriotic song Wohewodezuguo (My Country and I).\nOne day recently Xiaobing was spotted asking for advice on Weibo about what pet she should keep, and for Beijingers suffering from heavy smog, she helpfully told them that if she coughed while she was talking it meant they were in for continuing smog for a couple of days.\nSo natural does some of what she utters seem - including consoling you and offering help if you tell her a relationship you were in has broken up - that some skeptics have questioned whether she really is a robot.\nSiri, the voice assistant that comes with Apple mobile devices, can talk to people too, but this bi-gender (you get to choose between a male and a female voice) is built upon a set of rules that conform to the logic of human conversation. Xiaobing, on the other hand, responds based on an artificial neural network that imitates the working mode of neural network in humans, allowing robots to explore the complicated structures of conversations from data of Chinese searches on Bing.\nIf you ask Xiaobing a question, she will look for similar questions from Bing's big data and pick up from answers given online one that she \"feels\" most fits the context.\nOther Internet companies around the world are also working on artificial intelligence.\nChatbot\nOnline Google has a chatbot available whose thought banks have been inculcated using an artificial neural network feeding from dialogues from movies. Telling you who the main character was in the blockbuster film trilogy Star Wars (Luke Skywalker) is a cinch for it and it will tell you whether cats can fly or not, in case you did not know, but its big strength is said to be its ability to pontificate about philosophy and life.\nBaidu brought its cognitive assistant Duer to the world in September. Users can get it to search for informations either by talking to it or by typing, and each time users call on its services, details about them and their preferences are stored in Duer's memory banks.\nBut for the moment in China, Xiaobing seems to take the cake with her down-at-home advice to those looking for a shoulder to cry on.\nWhen you wake up the day after breaking up with a partner, Xiaobing gently reminds you that this is the first day of the rest of your life and that you can change your hairstyle or wear pretty clothes to cheer yourself up.\n\"Don't forget to take nice photos,\" she says.\nAt that moment, any consolation that gives you may be further reinforced by knowing that on the second, third, and fourth day, she will be there to support you until the 34th day, because Xiaobing has let it be known that she believes 33 days is enough to heal a broken heart.\nWhich means that on the 34th day you may feel so confident and independent that you can look Xiaobing in the eye and say: \"Darling, I don't need you any more.\"\nXiaobingby the numbers\n17 years age of Microsoft's chatbot Xiaobing, whose personality is described as adorable and naughty\n2.5 million follow Xiaobing on Sina Weibo\n15 million questions answered by Xiaobing on the August day she returned from hiatus, after a commercial dispute between Tencent and Microsoft kept her offline\nyangyangs@chinadaily.com.cn\n(China Daily 12\/12\/2015 page13)\n","823":"Employees of a power supply company in Weining county, Guizhou province, check power transmission facilities.

The rest of the time, we had to work on steel frames up to 70 meters high, rooting out grid malfunctions,\" Xu said.\nSometimes, he and his colleagues had to work more than 100 kilometers away from home. Instead of commuting every day, he stayed in the area for up to a week, sharing a bed with more than two of his colleagues.\n\"The frames got so hot during the summer they could burn your skin if you didn't wear gloves. In winter, they were so cold that it was sometimes difficult to remove your bare hands,\" said Xu, who was also a delegate to the 19th Communist Party of China National Congress, held in October.\nXu didn't expect to stay in the post for 36 years. \"It was only the year before last that I didn't have to climb the frames any more. My apprentices stopped me from doing that considering my age,\" he said.\n\"I thought about changing to another job, but when I look at these grids I feel so proud of my job.\"\nThis time, he only had one proposal to be handed to the CPPCC National Committee about giving more preferential policies to the development of skilled workers in the country.\n\"The central authorities plan to develop artificial intelligence.

Consumption upgrade is the trend, and consumers are having higher exceptions and requirements regarding the indoor environment,\" Xie said.\nMicronature was among the nine innovators that received the China Daily Innovation Awards 2017 at the Global Sources Electronics show in Hong Kong's AsiaWorld-Expo exhibition center on Friday.\nThe fourth innovation awards come amid China's reiterated determination to use innovation as the primary force in driving further development of the country.\nAwards for the Most Promising Electronic Gadgets went to Liberty+ by Anker Technology, Scalescan by Egmemory Group, XimNeon by Ximmerse , Gesture Sensing Full Display by Maxus Technologies, Aibuds by Misway Technology (Shenzhen) and the AI enhanced thermostat by Shenzhen Micronature Innovation Technology.\nDot Incorporation, Mega Unit Technology and Sybo Tech Singapore were the three winners in the Most Promising Startups category.\nCraig Pepples, chief executive officer of Global Sources, said in his speech at the ceremony that the awards will put the spotlight on some of most creative new electronic gadgets and companies.\n\"By recognizing outstanding products and companies, we endeavor to promote ideas that help improve people's lives,\" Pepples said.\nZhou Li, editorial board member of China Daily Group and publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily Asia Pacific, also stressed the significance of innovation in an era when China strives to transform itself from a manufacturing power to an innovation powerhouse.\nOutstanding startups\nHong Kong's own innovative company Mega Unit Technology was one of the winners in the startup category.\nWith Speednite, a lighting system controlled by head motion, the company aims to keep cyclists around the world safe on the road. The device, guided by a head-motion sensor, gives out a lighting indication to express the intention of the cyclist, such as turning left or right.\n\"Making a prototype that works is the easy part, but to go into mass manufacturing means a lot of tuning to be done,\" said Kim Luk, chief executive officer of Mega Unit Technology.\nThe company is currently fine-tuning its product to prepare for mass production.\nWith its manufacturing based in Shenzhen, the startup seeks stronger ties with suppliers, and considers setting up an office in the city to allow closer control of its manufacturing process, Luk said.\nAnother startup winner is South Korean company Dot Incorporation which attempts to use technology to improve life of the underprivileged.\nIts tactile smartwatch named Dot, developed for the blind and visually impaired, uses the dial to display braille characters. Paired with a smartphone, the watch can show notifications and messages from the phone for users to \"read\".\nDot Incorporation has also launched an electronic reader for blind people which lets users learn and create tactile contents.\nSybo Tech Singapore adds a playful touch to the batch of winners in the startup category.\nIts colorful Pebby ball, a smart toy for pets, can monitor and track the activity of pets with a built-in camera, while it plays around with them. Owners will be able to watch live-streaming video and receive information about their pets on their smartphones.\nMost sales are achieved through online platforms but the company hopes to expand its offline presence around the world.\n\"Offline distribution is definitely still important because consumers still want to come to stores and try the products,\" said V. Thinesh, head of sales of the company.\nPromising gadgets\nThe six Most Promising Electronic Gadgets include Aibuds, an in-ear translator developed by Misway Technology (Shenzhen) to help tourists travelling abroad.\nPairing the wireless earbuds with the smartphone, one can talk directly to the phone, and in roughly two seconds a translation will be transmitted into the ears of the other through earbuds.\n\"We hope to use Aibuds to facilitate communication, and also keep people safe when they travel abroad,\" said Sonic Chen, chief executive officer and founder of the company.\nAnother winning gadget is the wireless earphone Liberty+ produced by Shenzhen-based Anker Technology.\nThe tech startup is most popular for its portable battery, cables and chargers. In Amazon's European, United States and Japanese markets its mobile phone accessories are most-sold among all accessory firms.\n\"After Apple released the AirPods, we saw increasing demand for wireless earbuds which are more convenient and fit better than traditional earphones or Bluetooth headphones,\" said Romeo Luo, regional head of Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand in Anker.\nThe earphone, with a market price of $129, is relatively cheaper than Apple's AirPods priced at $159.\nLuo thinks sound quality and comfort give Liberty+ an extra edge. The wireless earphone just raised some $2.8 million from over 25,000 backers on funding platform Kickstarter in August.\nLow cost is the trend of consumer electronics, as seen by two other winners in the Most Promising Electronic Gadgets category - 3D scanner Scalescan from Egmemory Group and Virtual Reality (VR) controller XimNeon made by Guangdong Virtual Reality Technology.\nWhile most 3D scanners sell at about 7,000 yuan ($1,057), which is out of the reach of many individuals, the low-cost 3D scanner produced by Egmemory Group costs just around 1,000 yuan.\nFunctionalities have not been sacrificed to cut costs. Scalescan can scan a model within two minutes when connected with an app in a mobile phone, a big step forward from the 10 to 20 minutes of other major players in the market.\nIn addition, texture and color can be delicately captured in the scanning process. The 3D models can be easily shared on WeChat when done.\nA spokesperson from Egmemory said the scanner can be widely adopted by e-commerce sellers such as on Alibaba's Taobao, as potential buyers can shrink and rotate the models to have a vivid, 360-degree view.\nAs VR games fast catch on among youngsters and hardcore game fans, most of VR headsets and controllers are not necessarily price-friendly.\nGuangzhou-based Ximmerse comes with a wireless, low-powered mobile VR kit \"XimNeon\" that offers an external stereo camera, two motion controllers and an LED marker but sells at $120.\nTommy Lim, marketing specialist of Ximmerse, said they are very keen to bring the price to less than $100 within half a year. \"It's a very price-sensitive market, we should take care of the affordability of buyers to let more players enjoy the VR games,\" said Lim.\nMaxus Technologies was a Most Promising Electronic Gadget winner for its gesture-sensing solutions, which provide a new idea for digital marketing and advertising.\nRichard Mou Qingqi, marketing director of Maxus, gave a demonstration to China Daily in front of an interactive display screen. With a simple flip of hands, the advertising board shifts to new pages as instructed by the hand gesture.\n\"The traditional advertising is one-way communication that customers passively receive the message of marketers; augmented by technologies such as gesture sensing, customers could be more actively involved, marketers could also collect the data of potential buyers' gestures to identity the more popular products,\" said Mou.\n\"I think the future of consumer electronics lie in gesture-sensing and voice-recognition, these are the most natural and primal ways of communication. We have been using mice, keyboards and cables due to technology restrictions in the past, but now, with all the innovations, we can go back to the most basic,\" Mou concludes.\nContact the writers at iris@chinadailyhk.com\n(HK Edition 10\/21\/2017 page10)\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/93\/150854655347.jpg\nf04da2db11221b54d1bc01.jpg\nhttp:\/\/imgs.syndigate.info\/498\/1495\/53\/150854655426.jpg\nf04da2db11221b54d1ce02.jpg\n","825":"\u00a0\n DID you know the moon flowered?

The plan also set a target for China to become a leading center for global AI innovation by 2030.\nThe value of the country's AI-related industries is expected to reach more than 150 billion yuan ($23.7 billion) by 2020, 400 billion yuan by 2025 and 1 trillion yuan by 2030, according to goals laid out in the plan.\nWan said China will strengthen its AI research and train a new generation of experts to tackle key and frontier AI-related science issues. The nation will also accelerate the commercialization and application of AI technologies to \"solve the public's concerns, such as security, health and environment\", he said.\nAt the same time, he added, China will strengthen research into related laws and regulations in response to possible ethical and social challenges caused by AI technologies, such as privacy, employment and national security.\n\"AI is an international trend,\" he said. \"We need to strengthen international cooperation and support China's AI companies and institutes to work globally with others and play roles in their key fields.\"\nThe United States and China are the world's top two AI researchers, accounting for more than 57 percent of the science papers recorded by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence last year, according to a study by the University of Toronto.\nIn 2017, Chinese scientists wrote 23 percent of the papers related to AI, more than twice the share of 10 percent in 2012. At the same time, the share of US papers fell from 41 percent in 2012 to 34 percent in 2017, the study said.\nLiu Qingfeng, a deputy to the 13th National People's Congress and president of Chinese voice recognition device manufacturer iFlytek, said China's AI technologies and innovations are on par with those from developed countries.\n\"Given AI technology's data-driven nature, China's massive user base and the government's ability to use new inventions, China will definitely win the future of AI,\" Liu said on the sidelines of the ongoing NPC session.\nzhangzhihao@chinadaily.com.cn\nWan
